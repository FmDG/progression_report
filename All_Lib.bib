@article{burkePlioceneEoceneProvide2018,
	abstract = {As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3--3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129--116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 ({\textless}1\%) but reach 8.7\% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity.},

@article{jakobNewSealevelRecord2020,
	abstract = {Sea-level rise resulting from the instability of polar continental ice sheets represents a major socioeconomic hazard arising from anthropogenic warming, but the response of the largest component of Earth's cryosphere, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), to global warming is poorly understood. Here we present a detailed record of North Atlantic deep-ocean temperature, global sea-level, and ice-volume change for ∼2.75 to 2.4 Ma ago, when atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (
              p
              CO
              2
              ) ranged from present-day ({\textgreater}400 parts per million volume, ppmv) to preindustrial ({\textless}280 ppmv) values. Our data reveal clear glacial--interglacial cycles in global ice volume and sea level largely driven by the growth and decay of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, sea-level values during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 101 (∼2.55 Ma) also signal substantial melting of the EAIS, and peak sea levels during MIS G7 (∼2.75 Ma) and, perhaps, MIS G1 (∼2.63 Ma) are also suggestive of EAIS instability. During the succeeding glacial--interglacial cycles (MIS 100 to 95), sea levels were distinctly lower than before, strongly suggesting a link between greater stability of the EAIS and increased land-ice volumes in the Northern Hemisphere. We propose that lower sea levels driven by ice-sheet growth in the Northern Hemisphere decreased EAIS susceptibility to ocean melting. Our findings have implications for future EAIS vulnerability to a rapidly warming world.},

@article{bhattacharyaSizeFractionSpecific2021,
	abstract = {Carbon isotope (δ13C) records from marine sediments and sedimentary rocks have been extensively used in Cenozoic chemostratigraphy. The early Paleogene interval in particular has received exceptional attention because negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) documented in the sedimentary record, for example, at the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), ca ∼56 Ma, are believed to reflect significant global carbon cycle perturbations during the warmest interval of the Cenozoic era. However, while bulk carbonate δ13C values exhibit robust correlations across widely separated marine sedimentary basins, their absolute values and magnitude of CIEs vary spatially, especially over time intervals characterized by major deviations in global carbon cycling. Moreover, bulk carbonates in openmarine environments are an ensemble of different components, each with a distinct isotope composition. Consequently, a comprehensive interpretation of the bulk-δ13C record requires an understanding of coevolution of these components. In this study, we dissect sediments, from the late Paleocene-early Eocene interval, at ODP Site 1209 (Shatsky Rise, Pacific Ocean) to investigate how a temporally varying bulk carbonate ensemble influences the overall carbon isotope record. A set of 45 samples were examined for δ13C and δ18O compositions, as bulk and individual size fractions. We find a significant increase in coarsefraction abundance across the PETM, driven by a changing community structure of calcifiers, modulating the size of the CIE at Site 1209 and thus making it distinct from those recorded at other open-marine sites. These results highlight the importance of biogeography in the marine stable isotope record, especially when isotope excursions are driven by climate- and/or carbon cycle changes. In addition, community composition changes will alter the interpretation of weight percent coarse fraction as proxy for carbonate dissolution.},

@article{westerholdGlobalExtentEarly2018,
	abstract = {Studying the dynamics of past global warming events during the late Paleocene to middle Eocene informs our understanding of Earth's carbon cycle behavior under elevated atmospheric pCO2 conditions. Due to sparse data coverage, the spatial character of numerous hyperthermal events during this period is still poorly constrained. Here we present a high-resolution, benthic foraminiferal stable isotope record for northwest Pacific ODP Site 1209 (Leg 198) spanning 44 to 56 Ma with 5 kyr resolution. An existing Paleocene section was extended into the middle Eocene creating an unprecedented 22 Myr single-site record. Several identified carbon isotope excursions correspond in timing and magnitude to hyperthermal layers previously described elsewhere. Maxima in scanning X-ray fluorescence Fe intensities and pronounced minima in the wt\% coarse fraction characterize carbonate dissolution for all of the hyperthermal events. The new astronomically calibrated stable oxygen isotope record assists in defining the onset, duration, and demise of the Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, 49.14 to 53.26 Ma) and the onset of global cooling after the EECO (49.14 Ma). The cooling trend was interrupted by two warming episodes at 47.2 and 46.7 Ma. A major positive shift in the benthic foraminiferal carbon isotope record occurring from 51.2 to 51.0 Ma is now confirmed to be global. Benthic foraminiferal δ13C records from Atlantic and Pacific Oceans converge from 52.0 to 47.5 Ma pointing to a closer connection of deepwater convection initiating well in advance of the final connection {\textasciitilde}40 Ma ago or an increase in bottom water formation around Antarctica.},

@article{mckayAntarcticSouthernOcean2012,
	abstract = {The influence of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean on Late Pliocene global climate reconstructions has remained ambiguous due to a lack of well-dated Antarctic-proximal, paleoenvironmental records. Here we present ice sheet, sea-surface temperature, and sea ice reconstructions from the ANDRILL AND-1B sediment core recovered from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. We provide evidence for a major expansion of an ice sheet in the Ross Sea that began at ∼3.3 Ma, followed by a coastal sea surface temperature cooling of ∼2.5 $\,^{\circ}$C, a stepwise expansion of sea ice, and polynya-style deep mixing in the Ross Sea between 3.3 and 2.5 Ma. The intensification of Antarctic cooling resulted in strengthened westerly winds and invigorated ocean circulation. The associated northward migration of Southern Ocean fronts has been linked with reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation by restricting surface water connectivity between the ocean basins, with implications for heat transport to the high latitudes of the North Atlantic. While our results do not exclude low-latitude mechanisms as drivers for Pliocene cooling, they indicate an additional role played by southern high-latitude cooling during development of the bipolar world.},

@article{studerEnhancedStratificationSeasonality2012,
	abstract = {Coincident with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) around 2.73 million years (Ma) ago, sediment cores from both the open subarctic North Pacific and the Antarctic indicate a rapid decline in diatom opal accumulation flux to the seabed, representing one of the most abrupt and dramatic changes in the marine sediment record associated with the development of Pleistocene glacial cycles. In the North Pacific, bulk sediment nitrogen isotope data and alkenone-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates suggest that the productivity decline was driven by reduced exchange between surface and deep water, due to weaker wind-driven upwelling and/or a strengthening of the halocline (i.e. ``stratification''). In this study of the 2.73Ma transition at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 882 in the western subarctic North Pacific, diatom-bound nitrogen isotopes (δ15Ndb), alkenone mass accumulation rate, and alkenone- and archaeal tetraether-based SST reconstructions support the stratification hypothesis, indicating perennially lower export production, generally higher nitrate consumption, and greater inter-seasonal variation in SST after the 2.73Ma transition. In addition, the δ15Ndb of large and small size fractions of Coscinodiscus spp. suggest that these diatoms grew mostly during the spring bloom during the late Pliocene, switching to their current fall-to-winter growth period at the 2.73Ma transition; this view is consistent with their decline in dominance and provides further evidence for increased stratification (reduced vertical exchange) in the North Pacific after 2.73Ma. The δ15Ndb data indicate that, over the ∼100kyr period after the 2.73Ma transition studied here, nitrate consumption did not reach late Pleistocene ice age levels and that nitrate consumption in post-2.73Ma warm stages was similar to that before the transition, even though productivity was greatly reduced. We tentatively attribute this to relatively weak dust-borne iron inputs in the early post-2.73Ma period.},

@article{haugOnsetPermanentStratification1999,
	abstract = {The surface waters of the modern subarctic Pacific Ocean are isolated from the nutrient-rich waters below by a steep vertical gradient in salinity (halocline), a feature which is a dominant control on upper-ocean stratification in polar environments1,2,3. The physical processes which maintain the halocline and, in turn, its physical, biological, and geochemical effects have long been subjects of intense inquiry3,4. The stratification of polar surface waters influences the exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere5,6,7,8, so the history of the subarctic Pacific halocline may have played a role in past changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we report opal accumulation rates and nitrogen-isotope data from sediments in this region which indicate that the subarctic Pacific halocline developed abruptly 2.73 million years ago, coincident with the onset of extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The halocline would have reduced the transport of nutrient-rich deep water into the euphotic zone, leading to a decrease in biological production but an increase in the fraction of nutrient stocks utilized. This increase in the efficiency of the `biological pump' would have lowered the rate of CO2 evasion from ocean to atmosphere, potentially reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the suggested higher level of the preceding mid-Pliocene warm interval9,10.},

@article{fedorovPlioceneParadoxMechanisms2006,
	abstract = {During the early Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago, globally averaged temperatures were substantially higher than they are today, even though the external factors that determine climate were essentially the same. In the tropics, El Ni{\~n}o was continual (or ``permanent'') rather than intermittent. The appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial), signaled the termination of those warm climate conditions and the end of permanent El Ni{\~n}o. This led to the amplification of obliquity (but not precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface temperatures and in global ice volume, with the former leading the latter by several thousand years. A possible explanation is that the gradual shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds started bringing cold waters to the surface in low latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A future melting of glaciers, changes in the hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the early Pliocene.},

@article{deschepperNorthernHemisphereGlaciation2013,
	abstract = {The early Late Pliocene (3.6 to ,3.0 million years ago) is the last extended interval in Earth's history when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were comparable to today's and global climate was warmer. Yet a severe global glaciation during marine isotope stage (MIS) M2 interrupted this phase of global warmth ,3.30 million years ago, and is seen as a premature attempt of the climate system to establish an ice-age world. Here we propose a conceptual model for the glaciation and deglaciation of MIS M2 based on geochemical and palynological records from five marine sediment cores along a Caribbean to eastern North Atlantic transect. Our records show that increased Pacific-to-Atlantic flow via the Central American Seaway weakened the North Atlantic Current and attendant northward heat transport prior to MIS M2. The consequent cooling of the northern high latitude oceans permitted expansion of the continental ice sheets during MIS M2, despite near-modern atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Sea level drop during this glaciation halted the inflow of Pacific water to the Atlantic via the Central American Seaway, allowing the build-up of a Caribbean Warm Pool. Once this warm pool was large enough, the Gulf Stream--North Atlantic Current system was reinvigorated, leading to significant northward heat transport that terminated the glaciation. Before and after MIS M2, heat transport via the North Atlantic Current was crucial in maintaining warm climates comparable to those predicted for the end of this century.},

@article{baileyLowThresholdNorth2010,
	abstract = {Suborbital variability in late Pleistocene records of ice-rafted debris and sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean appears most extreme during times of enlarged ice sheets with a well-constrained benthic oxygen isotope-defined ``ice volume threshold'' (δ18OT) for the ``100 ka (inter)glacial'' world. Information on climate instability for the earlier Pleistocene and late Pliocene is more fragmentary and/or of much lower temporal resolution, but the data available suggest similar behavior with δ18OT remaining more or less constant over the past 3000 ka. This finding is puzzling because it implies that ice rafting is highly sensitive to ice volume on short (suborbital/glacial-interglacial) time scales but not to the long-term changes in ice sheet composition associated with intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG). Here we report new high-resolution records of stable isotope change and ice rafting in the North Atlantic at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1308 (reoccupation of Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 609) during two glacials key to intensification of NHG (marine isotope stages G4, ∼2640 ka, and 100, ∼2520 ka). We find a pattern of suborbital ice rafting events showing clear evidence of threshold behavior. However, contrary to previous reports, we find that δ18OT for the late Pliocene is up to 0.45‰ Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) lower than for the late Pleistocene. Using published Plio-Pleistocene global sea level records, we evaluate different potential explanations for this finding. We conclude that the observed Pliocene-Pleistocene offset in δ18OT is attributable to the existence of low-slung Pliocene ice sheets that flowed more readily than their late Pleistocene counterparts, associated with a smaller contemporaneous continental ice volume and less isotopically depleted ice.},

@article{molnarClosingCentralAmerican2008,
	abstract = {What role did the closing of the Central American Seaway play in enabling continental ice sheets to wax and wane over North America and Fennoscandia? A summary of relevant evidence presented here permits a causal relationship between them but can be interpreted to show none. The common denominator of such evidence is the approximate simultaneity of that closing with global cooling and the first major ice advance. At the resolution of paleoclimate, however, geologic evidence from Central America places only weak constraints on when interchange between Pacific and Caribbean water ceased. The strongest evidence for when North and South America became connected by a continuous land bridge, the ``Great American Exchange'' of vertebrates, assigns climate change the causal role, for an arid Central American climate, typical of glacial times, seems necessary for animals that inhabited savannas to pass through Panama. Paleoceanographic and geochemical studies of environments and water masses in the eastern Pacific, western Caribbean, and Atlantic in general call for continual change since ∼6 Ma or earlier, if evidence concurrent with global change near 3.5--3 Ma seems more widespread than for other times. Hypothesized connections between a closed seaway and glaciation commonly call for profoundly different North Atlantic Ocean circulation, but simulations using general circulation models provide a spectrum of differences in circulation for open and closed seaways. Might much (not all) of the evidence implicating the closing of the seaway in global climate change in fact be a consequence of that change and blind to Central America's tectonic development?},

@article{willeitRoleCO2Decline2015,
	abstract = {The Pliocene--Pleistocene Transition (PPT), from around 3.2 to 2.5 million years ago (Ma), represented a major shift in the climate system and was characterized by a gradual cooling trend and the appearance of large continental ice sheets over northern Eurasia and North America. Paleo evidence indicates that the PPT was accompanied and possibly caused by a decrease in atmospheric CO2, but the temporal resolution of CO2 reconstructions is low for this period of time and uncertainties remain large. Therefore, instead of applying existent CO2 reconstructions we solved an `inverse' problem by finding a schematic CO2 concentration scenario that allows us to simulate the temporal evolution of key climate characteristics in agreement with paleoclimate records. To this end, we performed an ensemble of transient simulations with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity from which we derived a best guess transient CO2 scenario for the interval from 3.2 to 2.4 Ma that gives the best fit between the simulated and reconstructed benthic δ18O and global sea surface temperature evolution. Our data-constrained CO2 scenarios are consistent with recent CO2 reconstructions and suggest a gradual CO2 decline from 375--425 to 275--300 ppm, between 3.2 and 2.4 Ma. In addition to a gradual decline, the best fit to paleoclimate data requires the existence of pronounced CO2 variability coherent with the 41-kyr (1 kyr = 1000 years) obliquity cycle. In our simulations the long-term CO2 decline is accompanied by a relatively abrupt intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at around 2.7 Ma. This is the result of a threshold behaviour of the ice sheets response to gradual CO2 decrease and orbital forcing. The simulated Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the early Pleistocene glacial cycles reach a maximum volume equivalent to a sea level drop of about 40 m. Both ice volume and benthic δ18O are dominated by 41-kyr cyclicity. Our simulations suggest that before 2.7 Ma Greenland was ice free during summer insolation maxima and only partly ice covered during periods of minimum summer insolation. A fully glaciated Greenland comparable to its present-day ice volume is modelled only during glacial maxima after 2.7 Ma and more continuously after 2.5 Ma.},

The modern Atlantic-Pacific salinity contrast of about 1‰ became fully established at 4.2 Ma as reflected by a 0.5‰ planktic foraminifera 18O enrichment in the Caribbean Sea. This is interpreted as the result of restricted surface-water exchange between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific in response to the shoaling of the Central American seaway. As a consequence, the Atlantic and Pacific surface-ocean circulation regime changed, as did the freshwater balance between the major ocean basins. Simultaneous shifts in benthic carbon isotope records in the Caribbean Sea suggest an intensification in North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. These results indicate that the Panamanian isthmus formation caused several new ocean-atmosphere feedback mechanisms that have affected climate since the early Pliocene.},

We use benthic foraminiferal δ13C records from the southern East Pacific Rise to characterize the δ13C composition of Circumpolar Deep Water in the South Pacific, prior to its transit through the Drake Passage into the South Atlantic. A comparison with published South Atlantic deepwater records from the northern Cape Basin suggests a continuous water mass exchange throughout the past 500 ka. Almost identical glacial-interglacial δ13C variations imply a common deepwater evolution in both basins suggesting persistent Circumpolar Deep Water exchange and homogenization. By contrast, deeper abyssal waters occupying the more southern Cape Basin and the southernmost South Atlantic have lower δ13C values during most, but not all, stadial periods. We conclude that these values represent the influence of a more southern water mass, perhaps Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). During many interglacials and some glacial periods, the gradient between Circumpolar Deep Water and the deeper southern Cape Basin bottom water disappears suggesting either no presence of AABW or indistinguishable δ13C values of both water masses.},

ISOW has historically been depicted as flowing counter-clockwise in a deep boundary current around the subpolar North Atlantic, but this single-boundary-following pathway is being challenged by new Lagrangian observations and model simulations. We show here that ISOW leaves the boundary and spreads into the interior towards the central Labrador and Irminger basins after flowing through the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone. We also describe a newly observed southward pathway of ISOW along the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The partitioning of these pathways is shown to be influenced by deep-reaching eddies and meanders of the North Atlantic Current. Our results, in tandem with previous studies, call for a revision in the historical depiction of ISOW pathways throughout the North Atlantic.},

@article{kiekeStudiesLabradorSea2015,
	abstract = {Labrador Sea Water (LSW), the lightest contribution to North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and one of the most prominent water masses of the subpolar North Atlantic, has seen remarkable changes over the past century. LSW originates in the Labrador Sea, where it is formed through wintertime ocean convection of varying intensity, depth and spatial extent. Formation of LSW, followed by its respective injection into the mid-depth circulation system, is mandatory for ventilating and renewing water layers of the interior ocean. Indispensably important for unraveling the history of variability in formation and properties of LSW as well as for mapping its large-scale spreading and export are sustained physical and chemical observations from the deep ocean. These observations started at the beginning of the 20th century from occasional mostly national surveys and today constitute large-scale multi-national collaborative efforts including a vast arsenal of sophisticated instrumentation. In a historical context, we revisit major milestones over the past 100years which have established and are constantly adding to shaping today's knowledge on LSW, and present first details on the latest vintage of LSW generated during the strong winter of 2013/2014. Respective Argo data reveal mixed-layer depths greater than 1700m marking formation of a new cold and fresh anomaly that has spread since then over the subpolar North Atlantic. We further summarize the on-going observational efforts in the subpolar North Atlantic and present a compilation of hydrographic standard lines that serve to provide top-to-bottom information on NADW components.},

Within glacial intervals we find evidence for variations similar to those observed in the late Pleistocene. We find discrete ice-rafted debris (IRD) events that reoccur every 2--5 kyr. These events are preceded by a short cooling and accompanied by a reorganization of glacial deep waters. The timing of IRD events in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene intervals is similar to that of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, but we find no IRD events comparable in timing to late Pleistocene Heinrich events. Although interglacial intervals are much more stable, we do find evidence for low-amplitude variations in deep water properties that reoccur every ∼2 kyr within interglacial intervals. The similarity between our late Pliocene---early Pleistocene records and late Pleistocene records implies that the mechanism driving millennial-scale variations cannot be uniquely attributed to the strongly nonlinear linkage between climate and insolation and the large ice sheets of the late Pleistocene.},

@article{huInfluenceVariabilityMeridional2021,
	abstract = {Abstract The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is an important global-scale circulation and changes in AMOC can induce significant regional and global climate impacts. Here we study the stability of AMOC and its influence on global ocean circulation and the surface climate though analyzing a set of sensitivity experiments using the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). Results show that a collapsed AMOC can induce changes in global ocean circulation, such as reduced (or reversed) Bering Strait transport and weakened Indonesian Throughflow and Agulhas Current, but strengthened Drake Passage transport. It also changes the global wind pattern and surface temperature, such as a seesaw-like surface temperature change between Northern and Southern Hemispheres, a weakening of the Indian--Australian summer monsoon, and a southward shift of the Southern Ocean westerlies. We also found that AMOC and the Pacific deep meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) do not form a natural seesaw under modern-day climate and geography. A collapsed AMOC (active PMOC) is not stable under modern conditions if there is no additional freshwater (salt) input in the subpolar North Atlantic (Pacific), suggesting that the modern mean state of AMOC (PMOC) does not depend on local haline forcing although its variability and changes do.},

	abstract = {Dense water formed in the seas north of the Greenland-Scotland ridge system overflows the ridges and sinks in the North Atlantic. The overflow through Denmark Strait provides the densest component of the Northwest Atlantic Bottom Water, a principal component of the North Atlantic Deep Water. Vertical hydrographic trends in the deep northwest Atlantic differ markedly, however, from those at and north of the Denmark Strait sill. Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW), the densest water mass found north of the sill, contributes less than 10\% to the overflow through Denmark Strait. Instead, the principal dense component of this overflow is an intermediate water of arctic origin, at slightly under 34.9\% and about 5 T.U. This water is in part formed in winter at the sea surface in the Iceland Sea. The remainder is of more northerly origin, carried southward by the East Greenland Current. Though this intermediate water mass is only slightly less dense than NSDW, its residence time (3 to 4 years) in the waters north of Iceland is an order of magnitude less than that of NSDW. Hence, the deep North Atlantic may be more sensitive to climatological and ecological perturbations than hitherto believed.},

@article{oppoWhatBenthicD13C2015,
	abstract = {Approximately synchronous with the onset of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), δ13C decreased throughout most of the upper ( 1000--2500 m) Atlantic, and at some deeper North Atlantic sites. This early deglacial δ13C decrease has been alternatively attributed to a reduced fraction of high-δ13C North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) or to a decrease in the NADW δ13C source value. Here we present new benthic δ18O and δ13C records from three relatively shallow ( 1450--1650 m) subpolar Northeast Atlantic cores. With published data from other cores, these data form a depth transect ( 1200--3900 m) in the subpolar Northeast Atlantic. We compare Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and HS1 data from this transect with data from a depth transect of cores from the Brazil Margin. The largest LGM-to-HS1 decreases in both benthic δ13C and δ18O occurred in upper waters containing the highest NADW fraction during the LGM. We show that the δ13C decrease can be explained entirely by a lower NADW δ13C source value, entirely by a decrease in the proportion of NADW relative to Southern Ocean Water, or by a combination of these mechanisms. However, building on insights from model simulations, we hypothesize that reduced ventilation due to a weakened but still active Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation also contributed to the low δ13C values in the upper North Atlantic. We suggest that the benthic δ18O gradients above 2300 m at both core transects indicate the depth to which heat and North Atlantic deglacial freshwater had mixed into the subsurface ocean by early HS1.},

@article{blindheimUpperLayerCooling2000,
	abstract = {Several time series in the Norwegian Sea indicate an upper layer decrease in temperature and salinity since the 1960s. Time series from Weather Station ``M'', from Russian surveys in the Norwegian Sea, from Icelandic standard sections, and from Scottish and Faroese observations in the Faroe--Shetland area have similar trends and show that most of the Norwegian Sea is affected. The reason is mainly increased freshwater supply from the East Icelandic Current. As a result, temperature and salinity in some of the time series were lower in 1996 than during the Great Salinity Anomaly in the 1970s. There is evidence of strong wind forcing, as the NAO winter index is highly correlated with the lateral extent of the Norwegian Atlantic Current. Circulation of Atlantic water into the western Norwegian and Greenland basins seems to be reduced while circulation of upper layer Arctic and Polar water into the Norwegian Sea has increased. The water-mass structure is further affected in a much wider sense by reduced deep-water formation and enhanced formation of Arctic intermediate waters. A temperature rise in the narrowing Norwegian Atlantic Current is strongest in the north.},

@article{barkerEarlyInterglacialLegacy2019,
	abstract = {Throughout the last glacial cycle millennial timescale variations in atmospheric CO2 occurred in parallel with perturbations in deep ocean circulation, which were themselves reflected by observable changes in surface conditions across the North Atlantic region. Here we use continuous proxy records to argue that an equivalent relationship has held throughout the last 800 kyr, that is, since before the first occurrence of Heinrich events (strictly defined). Our results highlight the importance of internal climate dynamics in amplifying external (insolation) forcing on the climate system to produce the large amplitude of glacial terminations (deglaciations) during the middle to late Pleistocene. We show that terminations are characterized by an interval of intense ice rafting followed by a subsequent and abrupt shift to anomalously warm surface conditions (with respect to the more gradually evolving background state), which we interpret to reflect an abrupt recovery of deep ocean circulation in the Atlantic. According to our synthesis, this is followed by a period of enhanced (or at least anomalous) overturning lasting thousands of years until equilibrium interglacial conditions are attained and during which atmospheric CO2 is likely to decrease. Our results therefore suggest that deglacial oscillations in ocean circulation can have a lasting influence on early interglacial climate and highlight the transient nature of atmospheric CO2 overshoots associated with the onset of some previous interglacials. Accordingly, we suggest that these intervals should be considered as a part of the deglacial process. This has implications for studies concerned with the evolution of atmospheric CO2 during interglacial periods including the Holocene.},

@article{ohnoMillennialScaleInteractionIce2016,
	abstract = {Waxing/waning of the ice sheets and the associated change in thermohaline circulation have played an important role in global climate change since major continental ice sheets appeared in the northern hemisphere about 2.75 million years ago. In the earliest glacial stages, however, establishment of the linkage between ice sheet development and ocean circulation remains largely unclear. Here, we show new high-resolution records of marine isotope stage 100 recovered from deep-sea sediments on the Gardar Drift, in the subpolar North Atlantic. Results of a wide range of analyses clearly reveal the influence of millennial-scale variability in iceberg discharge on ocean surface condition and bottom current variability in the subpolar North Atlantic during marine isotope stage 100. We identified eight events of ice-rafted debris, which occurred mostly with decreases in sea surface temperature and in current components indicating North Atlantic Deep Water. These decreases are interpreted by weakened deep water formation linked to iceberg discharge, similarly to observations from the last glacial period. Dolomite fraction of the ice-rafted events in early MIS 100 like the last glacial Heinrich events suggests massive collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet in North America. At the same time, our early glacial data suggest differences from the last glacial period: absence of 1470-year periodicity in the interactions between ice sheets and ocean, and northerly shift of the ice-rafted debris belt. Our high-resolution data largely improve the picture of ice-sheet/ocean interactions on millennial time scales in the early glacial period after major Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

@article{lawrenceHighamplitudeVariationsNorth2009,
	abstract = {We provide the first continuous, orbital-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) record from the high-latitude North Atlantic, a region critical to understanding the origin of the Plio-Pleistocene ice ages and proximal to regions that became frequently glaciated after ∼2.7 Ma. We analyzed sediments from Ocean Drilling Program Site 982 over the last 4 Ma for their alkenone unsaturation index and compared this surface water signal to a benthic δ18O record obtained from the same section. We find that while ocean surface temperatures were significantly warmer (∼6$\,^{\circ}$C) than modern temperatures during the early Pliocene, they were also as variable as those during the late Pleistocene, a surprising result in light of the subdued variance of oxygen isotopic time series during the interval of 3--5 Ma. We propose two possible explanations for the high orbital-scale SST variability observed: either that a strong, high-latitude feedback mechanism not involving large continental ice sheets alternately cooled and warmed a broad region of the northern high latitudes or that by virtue of its location near the northern margin of the North Atlantic Drift, the site was unusually sensitive to obliquity-driven climate shifts. On supraorbital time scales, a strong, sustained cooling of North Atlantic SSTs (∼4.5$\,^{\circ}$C) occurred from 3.5 to 2.5 Ma and was followed by an interval of more modest cooling (an additional 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C) from 2.5 Ma to the present. Evolutionary orbital-scale phase relationships between North Atlantic SST and benthic δ18O show that SST began to lead δ18O significantly coincident with the onset of strong cooling at Site 982 (∼3.5 Ma). We speculate that these changes were related to the growth and subsequent persistence of a Greenland ice sheet of approximately modern size through interglacial states.},

Here, we compare the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), northward ocean heat transport and ocean stratification simulated with these models. None of the models participating in PlioMIP simulates a strong mid-Pliocene AMOC as suggested by earlier proxy studies. Rather, there is no consistent increase in AMOC maximum among the PlioMIP models. The only consistent change in AMOC is a shoaling of the overturning cell in the Atlantic, and a reduced influence of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at depth in the basin. Furthermore, the simulated mid-Pliocene Atlantic northward heat transport is similar to the pre-industrial. These simulations demonstrate that the reconstructed high-latitude mid-Pliocene warming can not be explained as a direct response to an intensification of AMOC and concomitant increase in northward ocean heat transport by the Atlantic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The subtropical gyres include eastern boundary current upwelling systems: the Canary Current system in the North Atlantic and Benguela Current System (BCS) in the South Atlantic. The tropical circulation is predominantly zonal (east--west), including the North Equatorial Countercurrent and the South Equatorial Current, and has a low-latitude western boundary current (North Brazil Current; NBC). The chapter discusses concepts of wind forcing, and buoyancy forcing as they apply to Atlantic Ocean. It discusses subtropical circulation, Gulf Stream system, and Canary and Portugal current systems. An overview of Atlantic Ocean water masses and Meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic is also presented in the chapter.},

@article{orsiCirculationMixingProduction1999,
	abstract = {The Antarctic source of bottom water to the abyssal layer of the World Ocean is examined, as well as its large-scale flow pattern and ultimate entrainment rate into the deep water above. We make use of the available high-quality station data in the Southern Ocean to construct bottom maps of neutral density and mean property maps, including Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for the abyssal layer underneath a selected neutral density surface. The maximum density at the sill depth of Drake Passage is used to distinguish between the voluminous deep water mass that is a continuous component of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current from the relatively denser bottom water originated along the Antarctic continental margins. Based on water density, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is defined here generically to include all volumes of non-circumpolar water of Antarctic origin. Over the shelf regime multiple localized sources of specific AABW types contribute to the abyssal layer of the adjacent Antarctic basins. Characteristics of these dense bottom waters reflect closely those observed on the parent Shelf Water mass. Spreading paths of newly-formed deep and bottom waters over the slope regime, and their subsequent oceanic circulation patterns are analyzed on the basis of global property maps for the AABW layer. Interior mixing and interbasin exchanges of AABW are deduced from mean characteristic curves following the southern streamline of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Outflow and mixing of AABW from the Weddell Sea to the Argentine Basin is depicted using density and CFC distributions of two zonal hydrographic lines. Recirculation and mixing of deep and bottom waters within the Weddell Gyre are also detailed using a meridional section along the Greenwich Meridian. The strength of all localized sources of AABW combined is estimated by two independent approaches. An estimate of the total production rate of AABW is calculated based on the oceanic CFC budget for the AABW layer offshore of the 2500-m isobath. The sum of all downslope inputs of well-ventilated bottom water types underneath the top isopycnal must account for the measured CFC content in the bottom layer. The resulting total AABW production rate is about 8Sv, which is a conservative figure that neglects the loss of CFC-bearing waters across the top isopycnal in recent years, whereas about 9.5Sv is calculated assuming a well-mixed bottom layer. Making use of their transient nature, CFC distributions at the top of the AABW layer indicate that more direct and rapid entrainment of CFC-rich bottom waters below occurs over localized areas with relatively strong upwelling rates and enhanced vertical mixing. A second, more ad-hoc but independent oceanic mass budget of the bottom layer is also constructed. A typical basin-wide rate of deep upwelling of 3×10−7ms−1 requires 10Sv (1Sv=106m3s−1) of newly-formed AABW to sink down the slope around Antarctica. We have also formulated a spatial distribution of deep upwelling on the isopycnal at the top of the AABW. It is expressed as a combination of wind, topographic, and turbulent components, which in turn are functions of the isopycnal depth, bottom depth, and bottom layer thickness. This non-uniform upwelling field yields about 12Sv of AABW exported across the top isopycnal. Fortuitously, the overall average of upward speed at the top isopycnal (3.7×10−7ms−1) compares well with previous estimates of deep upwelling in the northern basins. A series of likely sites for strong vertical entrainment of AABW are clearly identified in the modeled distribution of deep upwelling, consonant with the observed CFC distributions on the top isopycnal. Altogether, regions with relatively high upwelling rates ({\textgreater}5×10−7ms−1) occupy only a quarter of the total areal extent of the top isopycnal, but they account for as much as 45\% of the total vertical transport.},

@article{jonesSizeMattersAnother2017,
	abstract = {Abstract The surface salinity in the North Atlantic controls the position of the sinking branch of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC); the North Atlantic has higher salinity, so deep-water formation occurs there rather than in the North Pacific. Here, it is shown that in a 3D primitive equation model of two basins of different widths connected by a reentrant channel, there is a preference for sinking in the narrow basin even under zonally uniform surface forcing. This preference is linked to the details of the velocity and salinity fields in the ``sinking'' basin. The southward western boundary current associated with the wind-driven subpolar gyre has higher velocity in the wide basin than in the narrow basin. It overwhelms the northward western boundary current associated with the MOC for wide-basin sinking, so freshwater is brought from the far north of the domain southward and forms a pool on the western boundary in the wide basin. The fresh pool suppresses local convection and spreads eastward, leading to low salinities in the north of the wide basin for wide-basin sinking. This pool of freshwater is much less prominent in the narrow basin for narrow-basin sinking, where the northward MOC western boundary current overcomes the southward western boundary current associated with the wind-driven subpolar gyre, bringing salty water from lower latitudes northward and enabling deep-water mass formation.},

@article{jonesInterbasinTransportMeridional2016,
	abstract = {Abstract The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is studied in an idealized domain with two basins connected by a circumpolar channel in the southernmost region. Flow is forced at the surface by longitude-independent wind stress, freshwater flux, and fast temperature relaxation to prescribed profiles. The only longitudinal asymmetry is that one basin is twice as wide as the other. Two states, a preferred one with sinking in the narrow basin and an asymmetrically forced one with sinking in the wide basin, are compared. In both cases, sinking is compensated by upwelling everywhere else, including the passive basin. Despite the greater area of the wide basin, the residual overturning transport is the same regardless of the location of sinking. The two basins exchange flow at their southern edge by a geostrophic transport balanced by the difference in the depth of isopycnals at the eastern boundaries of each basin. Gnanadesikan's model for the upper branch of the MOC is extended to include two basins connected by a reentrant channel and is used to illustrate the basic properties of the flow: the layer containing the surface and intermediate water is shallower in the active basin than in the passive basin, and this difference geostrophically balances an exchange flow from the passive to the active basin. The exchange flow is larger when sinking occurs in the narrow basin. A visualization of the horizontal structure of the upper branch of the MOC shows that both the gyres and the meridional flow are important in determining the flow field.},

@article{deboerEffectGlobalOcean2007,
	abstract = {A growing number of paleoceanographic observations suggest that the ocean's deep ventilation is stronger in warm climates than in cold climates. Here we use a general ocean circulation model to test the hypothesis that this relation is due to the reduced sensitivity of seawater density to temperature at low mean temperature; that is, at lower temperatures the surface cooling is not as effective at densifying fresh polar waters and initiating convection. In order to isolate this factor from other climate-related feedbacks we change the model ocean temperature only where it is used to calculate the density (to which we refer below as ``dynamic'' temperature change). We find that a dynamically cold ocean is globally less ventilated than a dynamically warm ocean. With dynamic cooling, convection decreases markedly in regions that have strong haloclines (i.e., the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific), while overturning increases in the North Atlantic, where the positive salinity buoyancy is smallest among the polar regions. We propose that this opposite behavior of the North Atlantic to the Southern Ocean and North Pacific is the result of an energy-constrained overturning.},

@article{archerEquatorialPacificCalcite1991,
	abstract = {In the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, the depth and shape of the calcite lysocline appears to have changed significantly in response to climate forcing (Farrell and Prell, 1989). Taking the Farrell and Prell record at face value, the lysocline apparently became steeper during each of the last eight glacial stages. Also, the accumulation rate of calcite during the last glacial maximum was 2--4 times higher than it was during the previous interglacial (Arrhenius; 1952,1988; Broecker, 1971; Farrell, 1991). A numerical model for calcite dissolution in sediment is used to interpret these observations. The model was validated by comparison with observations from the present-day ocean; these results are presented elsewhere. If the lysocline fluctuations in the equatorial Pacific are primarily a dissolution record, then changes in the glacial Pacific [CO3] of 20--40 µM can be inferred. Here I offer the alternative explanation that cycles in equatorial production are responsible for the observations. Higher rates of calcite and organic carbon rain to the sediment in the equatorial region would have depressed the calcite lysocline and increased the calcite accumulation rate, as observed. A twofold increase in glacial production appears to be adequate to explain the observations, but a precise determination is prevented by uncertainties in some of the model parameters.},

We report a modelling exercise, motivated by these results, that indicates the pattern of calcium carbonate preservation in the equatorial Atlantic and Indian oceans is most readily reproduced using a dissolution rate constant 10 to 100 times smaller than those measured in the laboratory. The model suggests that 40\% or more of the particulate CaCO3 rain dissolves at the calcite saturation horizon in response to organic matter degradation within the sediments, and that this effect is insensitive to the choice of dissolution rate constant in ranges measured. Implications are that the dissolution flux from the sediments is greater than previously thought, and that calcium carbonate preservation in the deep sea should be strongly dependent on the particulate organic carbon to calcium carbonate rain ratio.},

@article{neelinENSOTheory1998,
	abstract = {Beginning from the hypothesis by Bjerknes [1969] that ocean-atmosphere interaction was essential to the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade has not only confirmed this but has supplied detailed theory for mechanisms setting the underlying period and possible mechanisms responsible for the irregularity of ENSO. Essentials of the theory of ocean dynamical adjustment are reviewed from an ENSO perspective. Approaches to simple atmospheric modeling greatly aided development of theory for ENSO atmospheric feedbacks but are critically reviewed for current stumbling blocks for applications beyond ENSO. ENSO theory has benefitted from an unusually complete hierarchy of coupled models of various levels of complexity. Most of the progress during the ENSO decade came from models of intermediate complexity, which are sufficiently detailed to compare to observations and to use in prediction but are less complex than coupled general circulation models. ENSO theory in simple models lagged behind ENSO simulation in intermediate models but has provided a useful role in uniting seemingly diverse viewpoints. The process of boiling ENSO theory down to a single consensus model of all aspects of the phenomenon is still a rapidly progressing area, and theoretical limits to ENSO predictability are still in debate, but a thorough foundation for the discussion has been established in the TOGA decade.},

@article{reaNeogeneHistoryCalcite1985,
	abstract = {The depth--time pattern of calcite accumulation recorded at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) sites beneath the oligotrophic subtropical gyre in the south-east Pacific Ocean allows us to define here both the calcite compensation depth (CCD) and the lysocline. The Neogene CCD history is one of shoaling before 15 or 20 Myr and subsequent deepening to the present level of 4,100 m. A broad zone of increased calcite dissolution, 600 m thick, formed during early to middle Miocene time and has remained. This zone, the lysocline, denotes an important change in ocean chemistry and may reflect either an increase in the volume of more corrosive deep water beginning about 18 Myr and reaching steady state by 14 Myr, the time of rapid ice build-up in Antarctica, or an increase in calcite rain rate caused by an increase in surface-water productivity.},

@article{sulpisAragoniteDissolutionProtects2022,
	abstract = {In the open ocean, calcium carbonates are mainly found in two mineral forms. Calcite, the least soluble, is widespread at the seafloor, while aragonite, the more soluble, is rarely preserved in marine sediments. Despite its greater solubility, research has shown that aragonite, whose contribution to global pelagic calcification could be at par with that of calcite, is able to reach the deep-ocean. If large quantities of aragonite settle and dissolve at the seafloor, this represents a large source of alkalinity that buffers the deep ocean and favours the preservation of less soluble calcite, acting as a deep-sea, carbonate version of galvanization. Here, we investigate the role of aragonite dissolution on the early diagenesis of calcite-rich sediments using a novel 3D, micrometric-scale reactive-transport model combined with 3D, X-ray tomography structures of natural aragonite and calcite shells. Results highlight the important role of diffusive transport in benthic calcium carbonate dissolution, in agreement with recent work. We show that, locally, aragonite fluxes to the seafloor could be sufficient to suppress calcite dissolution in the top layer of the seabed, possibly causing calcite recrystallization. As aragonite producers are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, the proposed galvanizing effect of aragonite could be weakened in the future, and calcite dissolution at the sediment-water interface will have to cover a greater share of CO2 neutralization.},

@article{warrenWhyNoDeep1983,
	abstract = {According to climatological data, the low salinity of near-surface water in the northern North Pacific, which reduces its density so much as to prevent sinking to great depth there, is due to the small regional evaporation rate (which allows a substantial net freshwater input to tbe surface layer from precipitation and ronoff), in combination with the small rate of flow through the surface layer (which amplifies the effect of the freshwater flux on the salinity). The low evaporation rate is due in tum to the relatively low surface temperature (decreasing the specific humidity of the air at the air-sea interface), which seems to be caused mainly: {\textasciitilde}y: tho relatively large proportion of cold upwelling water in the inflow to the surface layer, contrasting with that in the northern North Atlantic where warm surface water to the south is the principal component of inflow. The reduction in southern inftow-and thereby in through-flow as wen-results somewhat from the absence of a sink for surface water in any: analogue to the Norwegian Sea, but probably in greater part from the more southerly extent of the subpolar gyre in tho North Pacific than in the North Atlantic, whereby little water from the subtropical gyre passes through the northern North Pacific. The latter feature indicates a linkage between deep-water formation in the northern hemisphere and the distribution of wind-stress curl. Some aspects of this process by which lowering the temperature of seawater can reduce its densityby decreasing its salinity through diminished evaporation-are illustrated in a simple model.},

This asymmetric global overturning pattern has persisted for the past 2--3 million years, with evidence for different ventilation modes in the deeper past. In the current climate, the Atlantic-Pacific asymmetry occurs because the Atlantic is more saline, enabling deep convection. To what extent the salinity contrast between the two basins is dominated by atmospheric processes (larger net evaporation over the Atlantic) or oceanic processes (salinity transport into the Atlantic) remains an outstanding question. Numerical simulations have provided support for both mechanisms; observations of the present climate support a strong role for atmospheric processes as well as some modulation by oceanic processes. A major avenue for future work is the quantification of the various processes at play to identify which mechanisms are primary in different climate states.},

@article{fiedlerHydrographyEasternTropical2006,
	abstract = {Eastern tropical Pacific Ocean waters lie at the eastern end of a basin-wide equatorial current system, between two large subtropical gyres and at the terminus of two eastern boundary currents. Descriptions and interpretations of surface, pycnocline, intermediate and deep waters in the region are reviewed. Spatial and temporal patterns are discussed using (1) maps of surface temperature, salinity, and nutrients (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite), and thermocline and mixed layer parameters, and (2) meridional and zonal sections of temperature, salinity, potential density, oxygen, and nutrients. These patterns were derived from World Ocean Database observations by an ocean interpolation algorithm: loess-weighted observations were projected onto quadratic functions of spatial coordinates while simultaneously fitting annual and semiannual harmonics and the Southern Oscillation Index to account for interannual variability. Contrasts between the equatorial cold tongue and the eastern Pacific warm pool are evident in all the hydrographic parameters. Annual cycles and ENSO (El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation) variability are of similar amplitude in the eastern tropical Pacific, however, there are important regional differences in relative variability at these time scales. Unique characteristics of the eastern tropical Pacific are discussed: the strong and shallow pycnocline, the pronounced oxygen minimum layer, and the Costa Rica Dome. This paper is part of a comprehensive review of the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific.},

@article{bartoliAtmosphericCO2Decline2011,
	abstract = {Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the onset of intensive glaciations on Greenland, Scandinavia, and North America during the Pliocene epoch between 3.6 and 2.7 million years ago (Ma). A decrease in atmospheric CO2 may have played a role during the onset of glaciations, but other tectonic and oceanic events occurring at the same time may have played a part as well. Here we present detailed atmospheric CO2 estimates from boron isotopes in planktic foraminifer shells spanning 4.6--2.0 Ma. Maximal Pliocene atmospheric CO2 estimates gradually declined from values around 410 μatm to early Pleistocene values of 300 μatm at 2.0 Ma. After the onset of large-scale ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere, maximal pCO2 estimates were still at 2.5 Ma +90 μatm higher than values characteristic of the early Pleistocene interglacials. By contrast, Pliocene minimal atmospheric CO2 gradually decreased from 310 to 245 μatm at 3.2 Ma, coinciding with the start of transient glaciations on Greenland. Values characteristic of early Pleistocene glacial atmospheric CO2 of 200 μatm were abruptly reached after 2.7 Ma during the late Pliocene transition. This trend is consistent with the suggestion that ocean stratification and iron fertilization increased after 2.7 Ma in the North Pacific and Southern Ocean and may have led to increased glacial CO2 storage in the oceanic abyss after 2.7 Ma onward.},

@article{raeDeepWaterFormation2014,
	abstract = {Deep water formation in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean is widely thought to influence deglacial CO2 rise and climate change; here we suggest that deep water formation in the North Pacific may also play an important role. We present paired radiocarbon and boron isotope data from foraminifera from sediment core MD02-2489 at 3640 m in the North East Pacific. These show a pronounced excursion during Heinrich Stadial 1, with benthic-planktic radiocarbon offsets dropping to {\textasciitilde}350 years, accompanied by a decrease in benthic δ11B. We suggest that this is driven by the onset of deep convection in the North Pacific, which mixes young shallow waters to depth, old deep waters to the surface, and low-pH water from intermediate depths into the deep ocean. This deep water formation event was likely driven by an increase in surface salinity, due to subdued atmospheric/monsoonal freshwater flux during Heinrich Stadial 1. The ability of North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW) formation to explain the excursions seen in our data is demonstrated in a series of experiments with an intermediate complexity Earth system model. These experiments also show that breakdown of stratification in the North Pacific leads to a rapid {\textasciitilde}30 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2, along with decreases in atmospheric δ13C and Δ14C, consistent with observations of the early deglaciation. Our inference of deep water formation is based mainly on results from a single sediment core, and our boron isotope data are unavoidably sparse in the key HS1 interval, so this hypothesis merits further testing. However, we note that there is independent support for breakdown of stratification in shallower waters during this period, including a minimum in δ15N, younging in intermediate water 14C, and regional warming. We also re-evaluate deglacial changes in North Pacific productivity and carbonate preservation in light of our new data and suggest that the regional pulse of export production observed during the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d is promoted by relatively stratified conditions, with increased light availability and a shallow, potent nutricline. Overall, our work highlights the potential of NPDW formation to play a significant and hitherto unrealized role in deglacial climate change and CO2 rise.},

	abstract = {The tropical Pacific thermocline strength, depth, and tilt are critical to tropical mean state and variability. During the early Pliocene ({\textasciitilde}3.5 to 4.5 Ma), the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) thermocline was deeper and the cold tongue was warmer than today, which resulted in a mean state with a reduced zonal sea surface temperature gradient or El Padre. However, it is unclear whether the deep thermocline was a local feature of the EEP or a basin-wide condition with global implications. Our measurements of Mg/Ca of Globorotalia tumida in a western equatorial Pacific site indicate Pliocene subsurface temperatures warmer than today; thus, El Padre included a basin-wide thermocline that was relatively warm, deep, and weakly tilted. At {\textasciitilde}4 Ma, thermocline steepening was coupled to cooling of the cold tongue. Since {\textasciitilde}4 Ma, the basin-wide thermocline cooled/shoaled gradually, with implications for thermocline feedbacks in tropical dynamics and the interpretation of TEX86-derived temperatures.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Deglacial transitions of the middle to late Pleistocene (terminations) are linked to gradual changes in insolation accompanied by abrupt shifts in ocean circulation. However, the reason these deglacial abrupt events are so special compared with their sub-glacial-maximum analogues, in particular with respect to the exaggerated warming observed across Antarctica, remains unclear. Here we show that an increase in the relative importance of salt versus temperature stratification in the glacial deep South Atlantic decreases the potential cooling effect of waters that may be upwelled in response to abrupt perturbations in ocean circulation, as compared with sub-glacial-maximum conditions. Using a comprehensive coupled atmosphere--ocean general circulation model, we then demonstrate that an increase in deep-ocean salinity stratification stabilizes relatively warm waters in the glacial deep ocean, which amplifies the high southern latitude surface ocean temperature response to an abrupt weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during deglaciation. The mechanism can produce a doubling in the net rate of warming across Antarctica on a multicentennial timescale when starting from full glacial conditions (as compared with interglacial or subglacial conditions) and therefore helps to explain the large magnitude and rapidity of glacial terminations during the late Quaternary.},

The Black Death (1347--1352 C.E.) is the most renowned pandemic in human history, believed by many to have killed half of Europe's population. However, despite advances in ancient DNA research that conclusively identified the pandemic's causative agent (bacterium Yersinia pestis), our knowledge of the Black Death remains limited, based primarily on qualitative remarks in medieval written sources available for some areas of Western Europe. Here, we remedy this situation by applying a pioneering new approach, `big data palaeoecology', which, starting from palynological data, evaluates the scale of the Black Death's mortality on a regional scale across Europe. We collected pollen data on landscape change from 261 radiocarbon-dated coring sites (lakes and wetlands) located across 19 modern-day European countries. We used two independent methods of analysis to evaluate whether the changes we see in the landscape at the time of the Black Death agree with the hypothesis that a large portion of the population, upwards of half, died within a few years in the 21 historical regions we studied. While we can confirm that the Black Death had a devastating impact in some regions, we found that it had negligible or no impact in others. These inter-regional differences in the Black Death's mortality across Europe demonstrate the significance of cultural, ecological, economic, societal and climatic factors that mediated the dissemination and impact of the disease. The complex interplay of these factors, along with the historical ecology of plague, should be a focus of future research on historical pandemics.},

The term thus refers to a driving mechanism. Important features of the thermohaline circulation are deep water formation, spreading of deep waters partly through deep boundary currents, upwelling and near-surface currents, together leading to a large-scale deep overturning motion of the oceans. The large heat transport of the thermohaline circulation makes it important for climate, and its non-linear and potentially abrupt response to forcing have been invoked to explain abrupt glacial climate changes. Anthropogenic climate change is likely to weaken the thermohaline circulation in future, with some risk of triggering abrupt and/or irreversible changes.},

Since there is about 50 times as much inorganic carbon dissolved in the sea as there is CO2 in the atmosphere, ocean carbonate chemistry has a great impact on in the atmosphere. On time scales of hundreds to a thousand years the main marine processes that influence in the atmosphere are the thermodynamic temperature dependence of CO2 solubility in seawater (the solubility pump), and the interplay between the rate of ocean circulation and the rate of biological carbon removal from the euphotic zone to the deeper reservoirs of the ocean (the biological pump). On longer time scales, of the order of one to tens of thousands of years, the preservation and dissolution of calcium carbonate along with the rate of weathering and the transport of bicarbonate to the sea come more into play.The Earth is presently in the early stages of a grand acid--base titration of seawater by CO2. Anthropogenic CO2 is being added to the atmosphere at a rate fast enough to have resulted in an approximately 30\% increase in the of the atmosphere since pre-industrial time.},

As yet, there is no broadly accepted explanation for this difference. Current investigations focus on the ocean's `biological pump', the sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior by the rain of organic carbon out of the surface ocean, and its effect on the burial of calcium carbonate in marine sediments. Some researchers surmise that the whole-ocean reservoir of algal nutrients was larger during glacial times, strengthening the biological pump at low latitudes, where these nutrients are currently limiting. Others propose that the biological pump was more efficient during glacial times because of more complete utilization of nutrients at high latitudes, where much of the nutrient supply currently goes unused. We present a version of the latter hypothesis that focuses on the open ocean surrounding Antarctica, involving both the biology and physics of that region.},

	abstract = {Chemical reactions in marine sediments and the resulting fluxes across the sediment--water interface influence the global marine cycles of carbon, oxygen, nutrients and trace metals and control the burial of most elements in marine sediments. On very long time scales these diagenetic reactions control carbon burial in sedimentary rocks and the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Sedimentary deposits that remain after diagenesis are the geochemical artifacts used for interpreting past changes in ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycles and climate. Constituents of marine sediments that make up a large fraction of the particulate matter that reaches the sea floor (organic matter, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe, Mn, aluminosilicates and trace metals) are tracers of ocean physical and biogeochemical processes when they formed, and of diagenesis after burial.Understanding of sediment diagenesis and benthic fluxes has evolved with advances in both experimental methods and modeling. Measurements of chemical concentrations in sediments and their associated porewaters and fluxes at the sediment--water interface have been used to identify the most important reactions. Because transport in porewaters is usually by molecular diffusion, this medium is conducive to interpretation by models of heterogeneous chemical equilibrium and reaction kinetics. Large chemical changes and manageable transport mechanisms have led to elegant models of sediment diagenesis and great advances in understanding diagenetic processes.We shall see, though, that the environment does not yield totally to simple models of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and laboratory-determined constants often cannot explain the field observations.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean is widely recognized as a potential cause of the lower atmospheric concentration of CO2 during ice ages, but the mechanism is debated. Focusing on the Southern Ocean surface, we review biogeochemical paleoproxy data and carbon cycle concepts that together favor the view that both the Antarctic and Subantarctic Zones (AZ and SAZ) of the Southern Ocean played roles in lowering ice age CO2 levels. In the SAZ, the data indicate dust-driven iron fertilization of phytoplankton growth during peak ice age conditions. In the ice age AZ, the area-normalized exchange of water between the surface and subsurface appears to have been reduced, a state that we summarize as ``isolation'' of the AZ surface. Under most scenarios, this change would have stemmed the leak of biologically stored CO2 that occurs in the AZ today. SAZ iron fertilization during the last ice age fits with our understanding of ocean processes as gleaned from modern field studies and experiments; indeed, this hypothesis was proposed prior to evidentiary support. In contrast, AZ surface isolation is neither intuitive nor spontaneously generated in climate model simulations of the last ice age.},

@article{galbraithBiologicalPumpLast2020,
	abstract = {Much of the global cooling during ice ages arose from changes in ocean carbon storage that lowered atmospheric CO2. A slew of mechanisms, both physical and biological, have been proposed as key drivers of these changes. Here we discuss the current understanding of these mechanisms with a focus on how they altered the theoretically defined soft-tissue and biological disequilibrium carbon storage at the peak of the last ice age. Observations and models indicate a role for Antarctic sea ice through its influence on ocean circulation patterns, but other mechanisms, including changes in biological processes, must have been important as well, and may have been coordinated through links with global air temperature. Further research is required to better quantify the contributions of the various mechanisms, and there remains great potential to use the Last Glacial Maximum and the ensuing global warming as natural experiments from which to learn about climatedriven changes in the marine ecosystem.},

These studies have significantly advanced the understanding of processes that control gas transfer, led to higher quality field measurements, and improved estimates of the flux of climaterelevant gases between the ocean and atmosphere. This review discusses the fundamental principles of air-sea gas transfer and recent developments in gas transfer theory, parameterizations, and measurement techniques in the context of the exchange of carbon dioxide. However, much of this discussion is applicable to any sparingly soluble, non-reactive gas. We show how the use of global variables of environmental forcing that have recently become available and gas exchange relationships that incorporate the main forcing factors will lead to improved estimates of global and regional air-sea gas fluxes based on better fundamental physical, chemical, and biological foundations.},

Marine productivity maxima and increased precipitation and riverine discharge from northern South America are closely linked to interstadial (warm) climate events of marine isotope stage 3, as recorded in Greenland ice cores. Increased precipitation at this latitude during interstadials suggests the potential for greater moisture export from the Atlantic to Pacific, which could have affected the salinity balance of the Atlantic and increased thermohaline heat transport to high northern latitudes. This supports the notion that tropical feedbacks played an important role in modulating global climate during the last glacial period.},

@article{huangRegionalVariationsOcean2017,
	abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) tend to cool sea surface temperature (SST) via enhanced vertical mixing and evaporative fluxes. This cooling is substantially reduced in the subtropics, especially in the northeastern Pacific where the occurrence of TCs can warm the ocean surface. Here we investigate the cause of this anomalous warming by analyzing the local oceanic features and TC-induced anomalies of SST, surface fluxes, and cloud fraction using satellite and in situ data. We find that TCs tend to suppress low clouds at the margins of the tropical ocean warm pool, enhancing shortwave radiative surface fluxes within the first week following storm passage, which, combined with spatial variations in ocean thermal structure, can produce a {\textasciitilde}1$\,^{\circ}$C near-surface warming in the northeastern Pacific. These findings, supported by high-resolution Earth system model simulations, point to potential connections between TCs, ocean temperature, and low cloud distributions that can influence tropical surface heat budgets.},

Furthermore, a linear regression model derived solely from dynamical model output can skillfully predict observed anomalies in these components at least a year or two in advance, indicating that these model-derived components and associated linear dynamics are realistic. These results suggest that interactive ocean circulation is not essential for the existence of multiyear predictability previously identified in coupled models and observations.},

	abstract = {We reconstruct trends in ice volume and deep ocean temperature for the past 108 Myr, resolving variations on timescales of ∼2 Myr and longer. We use a sea level record as a proxy for ice volume, a benthic foraminiferal Mg/Cabf record as a proxy for temperature, and a benthic foraminiferal δ18Obf record as a proxy for both. This allows us to construct dual estimates of temperature and ice volume variations for the interval 10--60 Ma: extracting temperature from δ18Obf by using sea level as a proxy for ice volume to constrain the δ18Osw component, and extracting seawater δ18Osw (which reflects ice volume) from δ18Obf by using Mg/Cabf to constrain the temperature component. Each of these approaches requires numerous assumptions, but the range of plausible solutions are concordant on timescales {\textgreater}2 Myr and within an uncertainty of $\pm$2$\,^{\circ}$C temperature and $\pm$0.4‰ δ18Osw. The agreement between the two approaches for the last 50 Myr provides empirical justification for the use of δ18Obf, Mg/Cabf, and sea level records as robust climate proxies. Our reconstructions indicate differences between deep ocean cooling and continental ice growth in the late Cenozoic: cooling occurred gradually in the middle--late Eocene and late Miocene--Pliocene while ice growth occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene, middle Miocene, and Plio-Pleistocene. These differences are consistent with climate models that imply that temperatures, set by the long-term CO2 equilibrium, should change only gradually on timescales {\textgreater}2 Myr, but growth of continental ice sheets may be rapid in response to climate thresholds due to feedbacks that are not yet fully understood.},

O) record and defines an overall cooling of about 12$\,^{\circ}$C in the deep oceans with four main cooling periods. Used in conjunction with the benthic δ

@article{rosenthalFactorsControllingFluoride1993,
	abstract = {This work is an assessment of the effects of seawater salinity and temperature on the incorporation of fluoride into calcitic shells of planktonic foraminifera and of the subsequent modification of shell chemistry by postdepositional dissolution. A strong correlation between the fluoride content of most planktonic species and their calcification depth was observed, deeper-calcifying foraminifera have lower fluoride content and heavier `*O composition, perhaps suggesting a temperature control on the partition coefficient. However, species deviations from this general trend and the absence of correlation between fluoride and sea-surface temperature within an individual species suggest that the coprecipitation of fluoride in foraminiferal calcite is more strongly controlled by biological processes rather than by simple chemical relationships. Foraminiferal fluoride shows weak or no correlation with sea-surface salinity. Core-top planktonic foraminifera from the eastern equatorial Atlantic (Sierra Leone Rise) show a substantial decrease of fluoride and, to a lesser extent, Mg content with increasing water depth (293 l5 104 m). These decreasing trends with depth are attributed to selective dissolution, i.e., removal of the more dissolution-susceptible fraction with a different chemical composition than the residual, a process which previously has been suggested to account for variations in the isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera. These findings indicate that foraminiferal fluoride cannot serve as a reliable tracer of oceanic paleo-temperature or salinity. It is possible, however, that fluoride may be useful for the study of dilution in deep-sea sediments.},

@article{nurnbergAssessingReliabilityMagnesium1996,
	abstract = {Though many studies on the Mg contents in the calcitic tests of foraminifers exist, the processes controlling its uptake are still a matter of debate. Laboratory cultures offer an excellent opportunity to reveal these mechanisms. The Mg concentrations within single chambers of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer (BRADY) maintained under controlled laboratory conditions were measured (1) at variable temperatures (19.5--29.5 $\,^{\circ}$C) and constant salinity and (2) at variable salinity (22--45‰) and constant temperature. The experimental results suggest that under natural conditions, temperature is the leading mechanism controlling the Mg/Ca ratio. Temperature and magnesium are related proportionally. A temperature increase of ca. 10 $\,^{\circ}$C gives rise to an increase of the magnesium concentrations of ca. 130\%. Drastic (unnatural) salinity changes dominate the effects of temperature. A 110\% change in the Mg/Ca ratio was observed when salinity was elevated or reduced by more than ca. 10‰. Specimens which underwent gametogenesis reveal significantly higher Mg concentrations than specimens that did not release gametes. Partition coefficients for Mg in foraminiferal calcite are orders of magnitude lower than values from inorganically precipitated calcite. When comparing observed Mg/Ca ratios of foraminiferal tests with predicted Mg/Ca ratios calculated according to empirical equations, it becomes evident that foraminiferal tests are undersaturated with respect to Mg for the water temperature they have experienced. Apparently, foraminifers are capable of controlling their Mg concentration. The physiological processes presumably responsible for such depressed Mg/Ca ratios appear to be temperature-controlled as deduced from the close relationship of the observed Mg/Ca ratios and water temperature. This study demonstrates that variations in temperature and salinity are definitely reflected in the Mg content of foraminiferal tests. Magnesium may thus serve as a paleo-proxy for past surface water temperatures, as long as postdepositional changes and salinity variations are of subordinate importance or can be excluded.},

	abstract = {The Loop Current mediating the oceanic heat and salt flux from the Caribbean Sea into the Atlantic Ocean and its interference with the Mississippi River discharge are critical for both the regional climate in the Gulf of Mexico area and the water vapor transport towards high northern latitudes. We present a 400-kyr record of sea surface temperature and local surface salinity from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (IMAGES core MD022575) approximated from combined planktonic foraminiferal δ18O and Mg/Ca, which reflects the temporal dynamics of the Loop Current and its relationship to both varying Mississippi discharge and evolution of the Western Hemisphere Warm pool. The reconstructed sea surface temperature and salinity reveal glacial/ interglacial amplitudes that are significantly larger than in the Western Hemisphere Warm pool. Sea surface freshening is observed during the extreme cool periods of Marine Isotope Stages 2, 8, and 10, caused by the strengthened Mississippi discharge which spread widely across the Gulf favored by the less established Loop Current. Interglacial and interstadial sea-surface conditions, instead, point to a strengthened, northward flowing Loop Current in line with the northward position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, allowing northeastern Gulf of Mexico surface hydrographic conditions to approach those of the Caribbean. At these times, the Mississippi discharge was low and deflected westward, promoted by the extended Loop Current. Previously described deglacial megadischarge events further to the west did not affect the northeastern Gulf of Mexico hydrography, implying that meltwater routing from the Laurentide Ice Sheet via the Mississippi River is unlikely to have affected Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.},

@article{jentzenMgCaD18O2018,
	abstract = {Abstract. Past ocean temperatures and salinities can be approximated from
combined stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) and
Mg ∕ Ca measurements in fossil foraminiferal tests with
varying success. To further refine this approach, we collected living
planktic foraminifers by net sampling and pumping of sea surface water from
the Caribbean Sea, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. Analyses
of δ18O and Mg ∕ Ca in eight living planktic
species (Globigerinoides sacculifer, Orbulina universa,
Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata,
Globorotalia menardii, Globorotalia ungulata,
Globorotalia truncatulinoides and Globorotalia tumida) were
compared to measured in situ properties of the ambient seawater (temperature,
salinity and δ18Oseawater) and fossil tests of
underlying surface sediments. ``Vital effects'' such as symbiont activity and
test growth cause δ18O disequilibria with respect to the
ambient seawater and a large scatter in foraminiferal
Mg ∕ Ca. Overall, ocean temperature is the most prominent
environmental influence on δ18Ocalcite and
Mg ∕ Ca. Enrichment of the heavier 18O isotope in
living specimens below the mixed layer and in fossil tests is clearly
related to lowered in situ temperatures and gametogenic calcification.
Mg ∕ Ca-based temperature estimates of
G. sacculifer indicate seasonal maximum accumulation rates on the
seafloor in early spring (March) at Caribbean stations and later in the year
(May) in the Florida Straits, related to the respective mixed layer
temperatures of ∼26 ∘C. Notably, G. sacculifer
reveals a weak positive linear relationship between foraminiferal derived
δ18Oseawater estimates and both measured in situ
δ18Oseawater and salinity. Our results affirm the
applicability of existing δ18O and Mg ∕ Ca
calibrations for the reconstruction of past ocean temperatures and
δ18Oseawater reflecting salinity due to the
convincing accordance of proxy data in both living and fossil foraminifers,
and in situ environmental parameters. Large vital effects and seasonally
varying proxy signals, however, need to be taken into account.},

@article{billupsApplicationBenthicForaminiferal2003,
	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of Cenozoic climate and ice volume as evidenced by the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater (N18Osw) derived from benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios to constrain the temperature effect contained in foraminiferal N18O values. We have constructed two benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records from intermediate water depth sites (Ocean Drilling Program sites 757 and 689 from the subtropical Indian Ocean and the Weddell Sea, respectively). Together with the previously published composite record of Lear et al. [Science 287 (2002) 269{\textasciicircum}272] and the Neogene record from the Southern Ocean of Billups and Schrag [Paleoceanography 17 (2002) 10.1029/ 2000PA000567], we obtain three, almost complete representations of the N18Osw for the past 52 Myr. We discuss the sensitivity of early Cenozoic Mg/Ca-derived paleotemperatures (and hence the N18Osw) to assumptions about seawater Mg/Ca ratios. We find that during the middle Eocene (V49{\textasciicircum}40 Ma), modern seawater ratios yield Mg/Ca-derived temperatures that are in good agreement with the oxygen isotope paleothermometer assuming ice-free conditions. Intermediate waters cooled during the middle Eocene reaching minimum temperatures by 40 Ma. The corresponding N18Osw reconstructions support ice growth on Antarctica beginning by at least 40 Ma. At the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, Mg/Ca ratios (and hence temperatures) from Weddell Sea site 689 display a well-defined maximum. We caution against a paleoclimatic significance of this result and put forth that the partitioning coefficient of Mg in benthic foraminifera may be sensitive to factors other than temperature. Throughout the remainder of the Cenozoic, the temporal variability among N18Osw records is similar and similar to longer-term trends in the benthic foraminiferal N18O record. An exception occurs during the Pliocene when N18Osw minima in two of the three records suggest reductions in global ice volume that are not apparent in foraminiferal N18O records, which provides a new perspective to the ongoing debate about the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet. Maximum N18Osw values recorded during the Pleistocene at Southern Ocean site 747 agree well with values derived from the geochemistry of pore waters [Schrag et al., Science 272 (1996) 1930{\textasciicircum}1932] further highlighting the value of the new Mg/Ca calibrations of Martin et al. [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 198 (2002) 193{\textasciicircum}209] and Lear et al. [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 66 (2002) 3375{\textasciicircum}3387] applied in this study. We conclude that the application of foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios allows a refined view of Cenozoic ice volume history despite uncertainties related to the geochemical cycling of Mg and Ca on long time scales.},

	abstract = {Geochemists have come up with a remarkable array of paleotemperature proxies in marine carbonates. These proxies work in diverse oceanic settings, in different organisms, in different parts of the water column, and on varied timescales. Several pairs of proxies, such as Mg/Ca and oxygen isotopes in foraminifera and Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes in corals, amplify each other when applied together because they allow for the determination of seawater oxygen isotope composition, a proxy for salinity. A remarkable amount of progress has been made in the last two decades on three new or revived paleothermometric approaches, each of which work particularly well in the tropics: oxygen isotopes in corals, Mg/Ca in foraminifera, and Sr/Ca in corals. This progress has expanded the importance of geochemistry in paleoclimate research and refocused its goals toward determining the temporal and spatial history of oceanic temperatures. Although many problems and challenges remain, and although none of the available proxies work perfectly, it is clear that recent research progress has elevated geochemical paleothermometers to a fundamental role in quantitative paleoclimate research.},

@article{groeneveldMgCaMn2013,
	abstract = {Abstract. Shelf and coastal regions are exceptionally important for many countries as they provide the main habitat for many economically important fish and shellfish species. With ongoing climate change and human-induced eutrophication the shelf regions are especially affected, resulting in increased temperatures and stratification as well as oxygen depletion of the bottom waters. In order to be able to predict the magnitude of these changes in the future, it is necessary to study how they varied in the past. Commonly used foraminiferal climate and environmental proxies, e.g., stable isotopes and trace metal/Ca ratios, that are applied in open-ocean settings are not necessarily applicable in shelf regions, either as faunas are significantly different or as conditions can change much faster compared to the open ocean. In this study we explore the use of Mg/Ca as paleothermometer and Mn/Ca as a potential proxy for changing dissolved oxygen conditions in bottom water on the benthic foraminifera Bulimina marginata and Globobulimina turgida. Living specimens were collected from the Skagerrak and the Gullmar Fjord (SW Sweden); the latter is hypoxic for several months a year. As the specimens were alive when collected, we assume it unlikely that any diagenetic coatings have already significantly affected the trace metal/Ca ratios. The Mg/Ca ratios are similar to previously published values but display much larger variation than would be expected from the annual temperature change of less than 2 $\,^{\circ}$C. An additional impact of the difference in the calcite saturation state between the Skagerrak and the Gullmar Fjord could explain the results. Mn/Ca ratios from G. turgida can potentially be related to variations in dissolved oxygen of the habitat where the foraminifera calcify. Samples from the Skagerrak display increased Mn/Ca in specimens that lived deeper in the sediment than those that lived near the surface. G. turgida samples from the low-oxygen Gullmar Fjord showed significantly increased Mn/Ca, being highest when bottom water dissolved oxygen was at a minimum. Our study suggests that trace metal/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera from shelf regions have the potential to record past variations in bottom water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations, but an additional impact of the inorganic carbonate chemistry cannot be excluded.},

@article{elderfieldTemperatureDelta18OSurface2000,
	abstract = {Determining the past record of temperature and salinity of ocean surface waters is essential for understanding past changes in climate, such as those which occur across glacial-interglacial transitions. As a useful proxy, the oxygen isotope composition (delta18O) of calcite from planktonic foraminifera has been shown to reflect both surface temperature and seawater delta18O, itself an indicator of global ice volume and salinity. In addition, magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios in foraminiferal calcite show a temperature dependence due to the partitioning of Mg during calcification. Here we demonstrate, in a field-based calibration experiment, that the variation of Mg/Ca ratios with temperature is similar for eight species of planktonic foraminifera (when accounting for Mg dissolution effects). Using a multi-species record from the Last Glacial Maximum in the North Atlantic Ocean we found that past temperatures reconstructed from Mg/Ca ratios followed the two other palaeotemperature proxies: faunal abundance and alkenone saturation. Moreover, combining Mg/Ca and delta18O data from the same faunal assemblage, we show that reconstructed surface water delta18O from all foraminiferal species record the same glacial-interglacial change--representing changing hydrography and global ice volume. This reinforces the potential of this combined technique in probing past ocean-climate interactions.},

@article{barrientosArcticOceanBenthic2018,
	abstract = {We explore the use of Mg/Ca ratios in six Arctic Ocean benthic foraminifera species as bottom water palaeothermometers and expand published Mg/Ca-temperature calibrations to the coldest bottom temperatures ({\textless}1 $\,^{\circ}$C). Foraminifera were analyzed in surface sediments at 27 sites in the Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, Lomonosov Ridge and Petermann Fjord. The sites span water depths of 52--1157 m and bottom water temperatures (BWT) of {\`A}1.8 to +0.9 $\,^{\circ}$C. Benthic foraminifera were alive at time of collection, determined from Rose Bengal (RB) staining. Three infaunal and three epifaunal species were abundant enough for Mg/Ca analysis. As predicted by theory and empirical evidence, cold water Arctic Ocean benthic species produce low Mg/Ca ratios, the exception being the porcelaneous species Quinqueloculina arctica. Our new data provide important constraints at the cold end ({\textless}1 $\,^{\circ}$C) when added to existing global datasets. The refined calibrations based on the new and published global data appear best supported for the infaunal species Nonionella labradorica (Mg/Ca = 1.325 $\pm$ 0.01 {\^A} e{\textasciicircum}(0.065 $\pm$ 0.01 {\^A} BWT), r2 = 0.9), Cassidulina neoteretis (Mg/Ca = 1.009 $\pm$ 0.02 {\^A} e{\textasciicircum}(0.042 $\pm$ 0.01 {\^A} BWT), r2 = 0.6) and Elphidium clavatum (Mg/Ca = 0.816 $\pm$ 0.06 + 0.125 $\pm$ 0.05 {\^A} BWT, r2 = 0.4). The latter is based on the new Arctic data only. This suggests that Arctic Ocean infaunal taxa are suitable for capturing at least relative and probably semi-quantitative past changes in BWT. Arctic Oridorsalis tener Mg/Ca data are combined with existing O. umbonatus Mg/Ca data from well saturated core-tops from other regions to produce a temperature calibration with minimal influence of bottom water carbonate saturation state (Mg/Ca = 1.317 $\pm$ 0.03 {\^A} e{\textasciicircum}(0.102 $\pm$ 0.01 BWT), r2 = 0.7). The same approach for Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi yields Mg/Ca = 1.043 $\pm$ 0.03 {\^A} e{\textasciicircum}(0.118 $\pm$ 0.1 BWT), r2 = 0.4. Mg/Ca ratios of the porcelaneous epifaunal species Q. arctica show a clear positive relationship between Mg/Ca and D[CO32{\`A}] indicating that this species is not suitable for Mg/Ca-palaeothermometry at low temperatures, but may be useful in reconstructing carbonate system parameters through time.},

@article{cassidyConstructionVolcanicRecords2014,
	abstract = {Detailed knowledge of the past history of an active volcano is crucial for the prediction of the timing, frequency and style of future eruptions, and for the identification of potentially at-risk areas. Subaerial volcanic stratigraphies are often incomplete, due to a lack of exposure, or burial and erosion from subsequent eruptions. However, many volcanic eruptions produce widely-dispersed explosive products that are frequently deposited as tephra layers in the sea. Cores of marine sediment therefore have the potential to provide more complete volcanic stratigraphies, at least for explosive eruptions. Nevertheless, problems such as bioturbation and dispersal by currents affect the preservation and subsequent detection of marine tephra deposits. Consequently, cryptotephras, in which tephra grains are not sufficiently concentrated to form layers that are visible to the naked eye, may be the only record of many explosive eruptions. Additionally, thin, reworked deposits of volcanic clasts transported by floods and landslides, or during pyroclastic density currents may be incorrectly interpreted as tephra fallout layers, leading to the construction of inaccurate records of volcanism. This work uses samples from the volcanic island of Montserrat as a case study to test different techniques for generating volcanic eruption records from marine sediment cores, with a particular relevance to cores sampled in relatively proximal settings (i.e. tens of kilometres from the volcanic source) where volcaniclastic material may form a pervasive component of the sedimentary sequence. Visible volcaniclastic deposits identified by sedimentological logging were used to test the effectiveness of potential alternative volcaniclastic-deposit detection techniques, including point counting of grain types (component analysis), glass or mineral chemistry, colour spectrophotometry, grain size measurements, XRF core scanning, magnetic susceptibility and X-radiography. This study demonstrates that a set of time-efficient, non-destructive and high-spatial-resolution analyses (e.g. XRF core-scanning and magnetic susceptibility) can be used effectively to detect potential cryptotephra horizons in marine sediment cores. Once these horizons have been sampled, microscope image analysis of volcaniclastic grains can be used successfully to discriminate between tephra fallout deposits and other volcaniclastic deposits, by using specific criteria related to clast morphology and sorting. Standard practice should be employed when analysing marine sediment cores to accurately identify both visible tephra and cryptotephra deposits, and to distinguish fallout deposits from other volcaniclastic deposits.},

	abstract = {The notion that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can have more than one stable equilibrium emerged in the 1980s as a powerful hypothesis to explain rapid climate variability during the Pleistocene. Ever since, the idea that a temporary perturbation of the AMOC---or a permanent change in its forcing---could trigger an irreversible collapse has remained a reason for concern. Here we review literature on the equilibrium stability of the AMOC and present a synthesis that puts our understanding of past and future AMOC behavior in a unifying framework. This framework is based on concepts from Dynamical Systems Theory, which has proven to be an important tool in interpreting a wide range of model behavior. We conclude that it cannot be ruled out that the AMOC in our current climate is in, or close to, a regime of multiple equilibria. But there is considerable uncertainty in the location of stability thresholds with respect to our current climate state, so we have no credible indications of where our present-day AMOC is located with respect to thresholds. We conclude by identifying gaps in our knowledge and proposing possible ways forward to address these gaps.},

              Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are moderate in most climate model projections under increasing greenhouse gas forcing. This intermodel consensus may be an artifact of common model biases that favor a stable AMOC. Observationally based freshwater budget analyses suggest that the AMOC is in an unstable regime susceptible for large changes in response to perturbations. By correcting the model biases, we show that the AMOC collapses 300 years after the atmospheric CO

              concentration is abruptly doubled from the 1990 level. Compared to an uncorrected model, the AMOC collapse brings about large, markedly different climate responses: a prominent cooling over the northern North Atlantic and neighboring areas, sea ice increases over the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas and to the south of Greenland, and a significant southward rain-belt migration over the tropical Atlantic. Our results highlight the need to develop dynamical metrics to constrain models and the importance of reducing model biases in long-term climate projection.},

Beyond the critical time, when the hosing stops the AMOC stays in a weak state with no recovery within 200 years.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Observations over the 20th century evidence no long-term warming in the subpolar North Atlantic (SPG). This region even experienced a rapid cooling around 1970, raising a debate over its potential reoccurrence. Here we assess the risk of future abrupt SPG cooling in 40 climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Contrary to the long-term SPG warming trend evidenced by most of the models, 17.5\% of the models (7/40) project a rapid SPG cooling, consistent with a collapse of the local deep-ocean convection. Uncertainty in projections is associated with the models' varying capability in simulating the present-day SPG stratification, whose realistic reproduction appears a necessary condition for the onset of a convection collapse. This event occurs in 45.5\% of the 11 models best able to simulate the observed SPG stratification. Thus, due to systematic model biases, the CMIP5 ensemble as a whole underestimates the chance of future abrupt SPG cooling, entailing crucial implications for observation and adaptation policy.},

@article{zhangDecadalVariabilityShallow2006,
	abstract = {In this study, we use existing observational datasets to evaluate 20th century climate simulations of the tropical Pacific. The emphasis of our work is decadal variability of the shallow meridional overturning circulation, which links the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. In observations, this circulation is characterized by equatorward geostrophic volume transport convergence in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9$\,^{\circ}$N and 9$\,^{\circ}$S. Historical hydrographic data indicate that there has been a decreasing trend in this convergence over the period 1953--2001 of about 11 Sverdrup (1 Sv = 106 m3 s{\`A}1), with maximum decade-to-decade variations of 7--11 Sv. The transport time series is highly anti-correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, implying that variations in meridional overturning circulation are directly linked to decadal variability and trends in tropical SST. These relationships are explored in 18 model simulations of 20th century climate from 14 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Significant correlation exists between meridional volume transport convergence and tropical SST in the majority of the models over the last half century. However, the magnitude of transport variability on decadal time scales in the models is underestimated while at the same time modeled SST variations are more sensitive to that transport variability than in the observations. The effects of the meridional overturning circulation on SST trends in most the models is less clear. Most models show no trend in meridional transport convergence and underestimate the trend in eastern tropical Pacific SST. The eddy permitting MIROCH model is the only model that reasonably reproduces the observed trends in transport convergence, tropical Pacific SST, and SST gradient along the equator over the last half century. If the observed trends and those simulated in the MIROCH model are ultimately related to greenhouse gas forcing, these results suggest that the Bjerknes feedback, by affecting pycnocline transport convergences, may enhance warming that arises from anthropogenic forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific. {\'O} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{thomasOceanicPathwaysActive2021,
	abstract = {In contrast to the modern-day climate, North Pacific deep water formation and a Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) may have been active during past climate conditions, in particular during the Pliocene epoch (some 3--5 million years ago). Here, we use a climate model simulation with a robust PMOC cell to investigate the pathways of the North Pacific deep water from subduction to upwelling, as revealed by Lagrangian particle trajectories. We find that similar to the present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), most subducted North Pacific deep water upwells in the Southern Ocean. However, roughly 15\% upwells in the tropical Indo-Pacific Oceans instead---a key feature distinguishing the PMOC from the AMOC. The connection to the Indian Ocean is relatively fast, at about 250 years. The connection to the tropical Pacific is slower (∼800 years) as water first travels to the subtropical South Pacific then gradually upwells through the thermocline.},

@article{suDifferenceNorthAtlantic2018,
	abstract = {The role of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in maintaining the large-scale overturning circulation in the Atlantic and Pacific is investigated using a coupled atmosphere--ocean model. For the present day with a realistic topography, model simulation shows a strong Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) but a near absence of the Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC), which are in good agreement with the present observations. In contrast, the simulation without the TP depicts a collapsed AMOC and a strong PMOC that dominates deep-water formation. The switch in deep-water formation between the two basins results from changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation and atmosphere--ocean feedback over the Atlantic and Pacific. The intensified westerly winds and increased freshwater flux over the North Atlantic cause an initial slowdown of the AMOC, while the weakened East Asian monsoon circulation and associated decreased freshwater flux over the North Pacific give rise to the initial intensification of the PMOC. The further decreased heat flux and the associated increase in sea-ice fraction promote the final AMOC collapse over the Atlantic, while the further increased heat flux leads to the final PMOC establishment over the Pacific. Although the simulations were performed in a cold world, it still importantly implicates that the uplift of the TP alone could have been a potential driver for the reorganization of PMOC--AMOC between the late Eocene and early Oligocene.},

@article{saenkoAtlanticPacificSeesaw2004,
	abstract = {A global, oceanic teleconnection of salinity, meridional overturning circulation (MOC), and climate of the North Atlantic and North Pacific is proposed. Simulations with a global climate model show that an extraction of freshwater from the Pacific results not only in an increase of salinity there, but also in a decrease of salinity in the Atlantic. As a result, a Pacific MOC develops while the Atlantic MOC collapses without freshwater perturbation in the Atlantic. Similarly, an input of freshwater to the Atlantic leads not only to a decrease of salinity there, but also to an increase of salinity in the Pacific. The Atlantic MOC collapses, whereas the Pacific MOC develops without freshwater perturbation in the Pacific. The mechanism behind this antiphase Atlantic--Pacific relationship is the positive feedback between ocean circulation and salinity contrasts, originally proposed by Stommel to operate between low and high latitudes. Here the authors show that the same mechanism operates on the Atlantic--Pacific interbasin scale, with the Southern Ocean acting as a pivot point for the interbasin seesaw. The proposed Atlantic--Pacific seesaw effect helps to explain some major out-of-phase oscillations of the climate states between the North Atlantic and North Pacific during the last deglaciation.},

	abstract = {Consequences from a slowdown or collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) could include modulations to El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and development of the Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC). Despite potential ramifications to the global climate, our understanding of the influence of various AMOC and PMOC states on ENSO and global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) remains limited. Five multicentennial, fully coupled model simulations created with the Community Earth System Model were used to explore the influence of AMOC and PMOC on global SSTs and ENSO. We found that the amplitude of annual cycle SSTs across the tropical Pacific decreases and ENSO amplitude increases as a result of an AMOC shutdown, irrespective of PMOC development. However, active deep overturning circulations in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins reduce ENSO amplitude and variance of monthly SSTs globally. The underlying physical reasons for changes to global SSTs and ENSO are also discussed, with the atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms that drive changes to ENSO amplitude differing based on PMOC state. These results suggest that if climate simulations projecting AMOC weakening are realized, compounding climate impacts could occur given the far-reaching ENSO teleconnections to extreme weather and climate events. More broadly, these results provide us with insight into past geologic era climate states, when PMOC was active.},

After {\textasciitilde}3.5 Ma, the restricted Indonesian Gateway might have amplified the East Australian Current, allowing enhanced heat transport towards the Southwest Pacific with reduced meridional temperature gradients when the global climate gradually cooled. At the same time our data suggest a cooling and freshening of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) or/and an increased northward flow of SAMW towards Site 590B, possibly a first step towards the present Antarctic Frontal System.},

	abstract = {Numerical experiments are conducted using an idealized basin to investigate roles of the deep vertical diffusivity and wind stress of the Pacific Ocean in the global and Pacific meridional overturning circulation. The Pacific middepth diffusivity is found to be enhancing the global meridional overturning circulation; when this part of diffusivity is reduced to the background value, not only is the layered circulation of the Pacific greatly weakened, but also the production of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is significantly reduced. The deeper part of the Pacific diffusivity is found to be enhancing the production of the AABW in the model. When the wind stress is turned off in the Pacific, the deep meridional overturning circulation of the Pacific is reduced and the production of the NADW and AABW is also significantly reduced. This is likely due to the reduction of the wind-enhanced upwelling in the subpolar and equatorial regions. These results suggest the importance of the diapycnal diffusion and sea surface conditions in the Pacific not only to the circulation within the Pacific but also to the global meridional overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) has been attributed to a rapid rise in greenhouse gas levels. If so, warming should have occurred at all latitudes, although amplified toward the poles. Existing records reveal an increase in high-latitude sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (8$\,^{\circ}$ to 10$\,^{\circ}$C) and in bottom water temperatures (4$\,^{\circ}$ to 5$\,^{\circ}$C). To date, however, the character of the tropical SST response during this event remains unconstrained. Here we address this deficiency by using paired oxygen isotope and minor element (magnesium/calcium) ratios of planktonic foraminifera from a tropical Pacific core to estimate changes in SST. Using mixed-layer foraminifera, we found that the combined proxies imply a 4$\,^{\circ}$ to 5$\,^{\circ}$C rise in Pacific SST during the PETM. These results would necessitate a rise in atmospheric pCO

	abstract = {The neodymium (Nd) isotopic composition of seawater has been used extensively to reconstruct ocean circulation on a variety of time scales. However, dissolved neodymium concentrations and isotopes do not always behave conservatively, and quantitative deconvolution of this non-conservative component can be used to detect trace metal inputs and isotopic exchange at ocean--sediment interfaces. In order to facilitate such comparisons for historical datasets, we here provide an extended global database for Nd isotopes and concentrations in the context of hydrography and nutrients. Since 2010, combined datasets for a large range of trace elements and isotopes are collected on international GEOTRACES section cruises, alongside classical nutrient and hydrography measurements. Here, we take a first step towards exploiting these datasets by comparing high-resolution Nd sections for the western and eastern North Atlantic in the context of hydrography, nutrients and aluminium (Al) concentrations. Evaluating those data in tracer--tracer space reveals that North Atlantic seawater Nd isotopes and concentrations generally follow the patterns of advection, as do Al concentrations. Deviations from water mass mixing are observed locally, associated with the addition or removal of trace metals in benthic nepheloid layers, exchange with ocean margins (i.e. boundary exchange) and/or exchange with particulate phases (i.e. reversible scavenging). We emphasize that the complexity of some of the new datasets cautions against a quantitative interpretation of individual palaeo Nd isotope records, and indicates the importance of spatial reconstructions for a more balanced approach to deciphering past ocean changes.

@article{uchikawaExperimentalEvidenceKinetic2015,
	abstract = {The boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in biogenic CaCO3 is being increasingly utilized as a proxy for past ocean carbonate chemistry. However, B/Ca of cultured and core-top foraminifers show dependence on multiple physicochemical seawater properties and only a few of those have been inorganically tested for their impacts. Accordingly, our understanding of the controls on foraminiferal B/Ca and thus how to interpret B/Ca in fossil shells is incomplete. To gain a clearer understanding of the B incorporation mechanism, we performed inorganic calcite precipitation experiments using a pH-stat system. As previously reported, we confirm that B/Ca in calcite increases with both fluid pH and total B concentration (denoted as [BT], where [BT] = [B(OH)3] + [B(OH)4{\`A}]). We provide the first evidence that B/Ca also increases with the concentration of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium ion. With the exception of the [BT] experiments, these chemical manipulations were accompanied by an increase in calcite saturation, and accordingly precipitation rate (denoted as R). But when pH and [Ca2+] were jointly varied at a fixed saturation level to maintain relatively constant R at different pH and [Ca2+] combinations, B/Ca was insensitive to both pH and [Ca2+] changes. These experimental results unequivocally suggest kinetic effects related to R on B/Ca. Furthermore, with a suite of chemical manipulations we found that the B/Ca variability is explicable by just R and the [BT]/[DIC] ratio in the parent fluids. This observation was particularly robust for relatively rapidly precipitated samples, whereas for relatively slowly precipitated samples, it was somewhat ambiguous whether the [BT]/[DIC] or [B(OH)4{\`A}]/[HCO3{\`A}] ratio provides a better fit to the experimental data. Nonetheless, our experimental results can be considered as indirect evidence for incorporation of both B(OH)4{\`A} and B(OH)3 into calcite. We propose a simple mathematical expression to describe the mode of B incorporation into synthetic calcite that depends only on the fluid [BT]/[DIC] ratio and the precipitation rate R. This novel finding has important implications for future calibrations and applications of the B/Ca proxy as well as the d11B paleo-pH proxy.},

@article{uchikawaInfluenceSolutionChemistry2017,
	abstract = {The ratio of boron to calcium (B/Ca) in marine biogenic carbonates has been proposed as a proxy for properties of seawater carbonate chemistry. Applying this proxy to planktic foraminifera residing in the surface seawater largely in equilibrium with the atmosphere may provide a valuable handle on past atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, precise controls on B/Ca in planktic foraminifera remain enigmatic because it has been shown to depend on multiple physicochemical seawater properties. To help establish a firm inorganic basis for interpreting the B/Ca records, we examined the effect of a suite of chemical parameters ([Ca2+], pH, [DIC], salinity and [PO43{\`A}]) on B/Ca in inorganic calcite precipitated in artificial seawater. These parameters were primarily varied individually while keeping all others constant, but we also tested the influence of pH and [DIC] at a constant calcite precipitation rate (R) by concurrent [Ca2+] adjustments. In the simple [Ca2+], pH and [DIC] experiments, both R and B/Ca increased with these parameters. In the pH--[Ca2+] and [DIC]--[Ca2+] experiments at constant R, on the other hand, B/Ca was invariant at different pH and decreased with [DIC], respectively. These patterns agree with the behavior of solution [BTotal/DIC] ratio such that, at a fixed [BTotal], it is independent of pH but decreases with [DIC]. Based on these results, R and [BTotal/DIC] ratio appear to be the primary controls on B/Ca in inorganic calcite, suggesting that both B(OH)4{\`A} and B(OH)3 are possibly involved in B incorporation. Moreover, B/Ca modestly increased with salinity and [PO43{\`A}]. Inorganic calcite precipitated at higher R and in the presence of oxyanions such as SO42{\`A} and PO43{\`A} in growth solutions often undergoes surface roughening due to formation of crystallographic defects, vacancies and, occasionally, amorphous/hydrous CaCO3. These non-lattice sites may provide additional space for B, particularly B(OH)3. Consequently, besides the macroscopic influence of R and bulk solution chemistry, molecular-scale processes associated with calcite nucleation can be an important consideration for B incorporation, especially in complex ionic solutions. Lastly, the covariance of B/Ca with [DIC] and salinity observed here qualitatively agrees with those in planktic foraminifers. It follows that their impact on foraminiferal B/Ca is partly inorganically driven, which may explain why the effect is evident across different species.},

@article{raeBoronIsotopesCa2011,
	abstract = {Accurate records of the state of the ocean carbonate system are critical for understanding past changes in pCO2, ocean acidification and climate. The chemical principles underlying the proxy of oceanic pH provided by the boron isotope ratio of foraminiferal carbonate are relatively well understood, but the proxy's reliability has been questioned. We present 76 new Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) δ11B measurements on a range of benthic foraminifera from 23 late-Holocene samples from the Atlantic that reaffirm the utility of the δ11B-pH proxy. Our boron isotope measurements on {\textasciitilde} 10 benthic foraminifera tests typically yield a precision of {\textasciitilde} $\pm$ 0.25‰ at 2 s.d. (equivalent to {\textasciitilde} $\pm$ 0.03 pH units). δ11B values of epifaunal species are within analytical uncertainty of those predicted from a simple model assuming sole incorporation of B(OH)4− from seawater and no vital effects, using the independently determined fractionation factor of 1.0272 between 11B/10B of aqueous boron species. Infaunal foraminifera are consistent with this model, but record the combined effects of lower pore-water δ11B and pH. No influence of partial dissolution or shell size on δ11B is observed. We have also measured the B/Ca ratios of the same samples. For individual Cibicidoides species, B/Ca shows a good correlation with Δ[CO32−], but the B/Ca of different cooccurring species morphotypes varies considerably. These effects are not seen in δ11B, which may therefore provide a more robust proxy of the ocean carbonate system. Whilst in theory δ11B and B/Ca can be combined to provide a quantitative reconstruction of alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC), in practice this is precluded by propagated uncertainties. δ11B data give significant constraints on foraminifera calcification mechanisms, and seem most simply explained by incorporation of B(OH)4− into a HCO3− pool, which is then completely incorporated in foraminiferal CaCO3. Our demonstration of the predictable variation of δ11B with pH, across a wide range of species and locations, provides confidence in the application of MC-ICPMS measurements of foraminiferal δ11B to reconstruct past changes in the ocean carbonate system.},

Cold-tongue SST varied coherently with precession-induced changes in seasonality during the past 30,000 years.

	abstract = {A number of studies have shown that the boron isotopic composition (δ11B) and the B / Ca ratio of biogenic carbonates (mostly foraminifers) can serve as proxies for two parameters of the ocean's carbonate chemistry, rendering it possible to calculate the entire carbonate system. However, the B incorporation mechanism into marine carbonates is still not fully understood and analyses of field samples show species-specific and hydrographic effects on the B proxies complicating their application. Identifying the carbonate system parameter influencing boron incorporation is difficult due to the co-variation of pH, CO23− and B(OH)−4 . To shed light on the question which parameter of the carbonate system is related to the boron incorporation, we performed culture experiments with the benthic symbiont-bearing foraminifer Amphistegina lessonii using a decoupled pH--CO23− chemistry. The determination of the δ11B and B / Ca ratios was performed simultaneously by means of a new in situ technique combining optical emission spectroscopy and laser ablation MC-ICP-MS. The boron isotopic composition in the tests gets heavier with increasing pH and B / Ca increases with increasing B(OH)−4 / HCO−3 of the culture media. The latter indicates that boron uptake of A. lessonii features a competition between B(OH)−4 and HCO−3 . Furthermore, the simultaneous determination of B / Ca and δ11B on single specimens allows for assessing the relative variability of these parameters. Among different treatments the B / Ca shows an increasing variability with increasing boron concentration in the test whereas the variability in the isotope distribution is constant.},

Radiogenic isotope budgets underlined the importance of taking into account continental margins as a source of elements to oceans. They also highlighted that the net land--ocean inputs of chemical species probably result from particle-dissolved exchange processes, named `Boundary Exchange'. Yet, locations where `Boundary Exchange' occurs are not clearly identified and reviewed here: discharge of huge amount of freshly weathered particles at the river mouths, submarine weathering of deposited sediments along the margins, submarine groundwater discharges and subterranean estuaries. As a whole, we conclude that all of them might contribute to `Boundary Exchange'.

@article{henehanNoIonIsland2022,
	abstract = {Boron isotope ratios -- as measured in marine calcium carbonate -- are an established tracer of past seawater and calcifying fluid pH, and thus a powerful tool for probing marine calcifier physiology and reconstructing past atmospheric CO2 levels. For such applications, understanding the inorganic baseline upon which foraminiferal vital effects or coral pH upregulation are superimposed should be an important prerequisite. Yet, investigations into boron isotope fractionation in synthetic CaCO3 polymorphs have often reported variable and even conflicting results, implying our understanding of the pathways of boron incorporation into calcium carbonate is incomplete. Here we address this topic with experimental data from synthetic calcite and aragonite precipitated across a range of pH in the presence of both Mg and Ca. We observe coherent patterns in B/Ca and Na/Ca ratios that, we suggest, point to paired substitution of Na and B into the carbonate lattice to achieve local charge balance. In addition, we confirm the results of previous studies that the boron isotope composition of inorganic aragonite precipitates closely reflects that of aqueous borate ion, but that inorganic calcites display a higher degree of scatter, and diverge from the boron isotope composition of aqueous borate ion at low pH. With reference to the simultaneous incorporation of other trace and minor elements, we put forward possible explanations for the observed variability in the concentration and isotopic composition of boron in synthetic CaCO3. In particular, we highlight the potential importance of interface electrostatics in driving variability in our own and published synthetic carbonate datasets. Importantly for palaeo-reconstruction, however, these electrostatic effects are unlikely to play as important a role during natural precipitation of biogenic carbonates.},

	abstract = {Neodymium (Nd) isotopes are considered a valuable tracer of modern and past ocean circulation. However, the promise of Nd isotope as a water mass tracer is hindered because there is not an entirely self-consistent model of the marine geochemical cycle of rare earth elements (REEs, of which Nd is one). That is, the prevailing mechanisms to describe the distributions of elemental and isotopic Nd are not completely reconciled. Here, we use published [Nd] and Nd isotope data to examine the prevailing model assumptions, and further compare these data to emergent alternative models that emphasize benthic processes in controlling the cycle of marine REEs and Nd isotopes. Our conclusion is that changing from a ``top-down'' driven model for REE cycling to one of a ``bottom-up'' benthic source model can provide consistent interpretations of these data for both elemental and isotopic Nd distributions. We discuss the implications such a benthic flux model carries for interpretation of Nd isotope data as a tracer for understanding modern and past changes in ocean circulation.},

@article{fosterSeawaterPHPCO22008,
	abstract = {Here a new analytical methodology is described for measuring the isotopic composition of boron in foraminifera using multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). This new approach is fast (∼ 10 samples analysed in duplicate per analytical session) and accurate (to better than 0.25‰ at 95\% confidence) with acceptable sample size requirements (1--3 mg of carbonate). A core top calibration of several common planktic and two benthic species from geographically widespread localities shows a very close agreement between the isotopic composition measured by MC-ICPMS and the isotopic composition of B(OH)4− in seawater (as predicted using the recently measured isotopic equilibrium factor of 1.0272) at the depth of habitat. A down core and core top investigation of boron concentration (B/Ca ratio) shows that the partition coefficient is influenced by [CO23−] complicating the application of this proxy. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that these two proxies can be used to fully constrain the carbonate system of surface water in the Caribbean Sea (ODP Site 999A) over the last 130 kyr. This reconstruction shows that during much of the Holocene and the last interglacial period surface water at Site 999A was in equilibrium with the atmosphere with respect to CO2. During the intervening colder periods although the surface water pCO2 was lower than the Holocene, it was a minor to significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere possibly due to either an expansion of the eastern equatorial Atlantic upwelling zone, or a more local expansion of coastal upwelling in the southern Caribbean. Such reorganisation of the oceanic carbonate system in favour of a larger source of CO2 to the atmosphere from the equatorial ocean may require mechanisms responsible for lowering atmospheric CO2 during glacial periods to be more efficient than previously supposed.},

	abstract = {Benthic foraminiferal magnesium/calcium ratios were determined on one hundred and forty core-top samples from the Atlantic Ocean, the Norwegian Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Pacific Ocean, mostly at sites with bottom water temperatures below 5 $\,^{\circ}$C. Mg/Ca ratios are consistently lower, by ∼ 0.2 mmol/mol, in samples cleaned using oxidative and reductive steps than using oxidative cleaning. Differences between Cibicidoides species have been identified: Mg/Ca of Cibicidoides robertsonianus N Cibicidoides kullenbergi N Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi. Comparison with bottom water temperatures support observations of lowered Mg/Ca of C. wuellerstorfi at temperature below ∼ 3 $\,^{\circ}$C compared with values predicted by published calibrations and from other Cibicidoides species. Hydrographic data shows that carbonate ion saturation (Δ[CO32−]) decreases rapidly below this temperature. An empirical sensitivity of Δ[CO32−] on Mg/Ca has been established for C. wuellerstorfi of 0.0086 $\pm$ 0.0006 mmol/mol/ μmol/kg. A novel application using modern temperatures and Last Glacial Maximum temperatures derived via pore fluid modelling supports a carbonate ion saturation state effect on Mg incorporation. This may significantly affect calculated δ18Oseawater obtained from foraminiferal δ18O and Mg/Ca temperature.},

@article{duEvolutionGlobalOverturning2020,
	abstract = {The Global Overturning Circulation is linked to climate change on glacial-interglacial and multimillennial timescales. The understanding of past climate-circulation links remains hindered by apparent conflicts among proxy measures of circulation. Here we reconstruct circulation changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on a global synthesis of authigenic neodymium isotope records (εNd). We propose the bottom-up framework of interpreting seawater and authigenic εNd considering not only conservative watermass mixing, but also the preformed properties and the non-conservative behavior of εNd, both subject to sedimentary influences. We extract the major spatial-temporal modes of authigenic εNd using Principal Component Analysis, and make a first-order circulation reconstruction with budget-constrained box model simulations. We show that during the LGM, the source region of North Atlantic overturning shifted southward, which led to more radiogenic preformed εNd of glacial Northern Source Water (NSW). Considering this preformed effect, we infer that glacial deep Atlantic had a similar proportion of NSW as today, although the overall strength of glacial circulation appears reduced from both North Atlantic and Southern Ocean sources, which increased the relative importance of nonconservative behavior of εNd and may have facilitated accumulation of respired carbon in the deep ocean. During the deglaciation, we find that Southern Ocean overturning increased, which offset suppressed North Atlantic overturning and resulted in a net stronger global abyssal circulation. Faster global scale deglacial circulation reduced the relative importance of non-conservative effects, resulting in AtlanticPacific convergence of abyssal εNd signatures. Variations of Southern Ocean overturning likely drove a significant fraction of deglacial changes in atmospheric CO2 and oceanic heat budget.},

@article{duNeodymiumIsotopesAuthigenic2016,
	abstract = {The isotopic composition of neodymium (eNd) extracted from sedimentary Fe--Mn oxyhydroxide offers potential for reconstructing paleo-circulation, but its application depends on extraction methodology and the mechanisms that relate authigenic eNd to bottom water. Here we test methods to extract authigenic eNd from Gulf of Alaska (GOA) sediments and assess sources of leachate Nd, including potential contamination from trace dispersed volcanic ash. We show that one dominant phase is extracted via leaching of core-top sediments. Major and trace element geochemistry demonstrate that this phase is authigenic Fe--Mn oxyhydroxide. Contamination of leachate (authigenic) Nd from detrital sources is insignificant ({\textless}1\%); our empirical results are consistent with established kinetic mineral dissolution rates and theory. Contamination of extracted eNd from leaching of volcanic ash is below analytical uncertainty. However, the eNd of core-top leachates in the GOA is consistently more radiogenic than bottom water. We infer that authigenic phases record pore water eNd, and the relationships of eNd among bottom waters, pore waters, authigenic phases and detrital sediments are primarily governed by the exposure time of bottom water to sea-floor sediments, rate of exchange across the sediment-water interface and the reactivity and composition of detrital sediments. We show that this conceptual model is applicable on the Pacific basin scale and provide a new framework to understand the role of authigenic phases in both modern and paleo-applications, including the use of authigenic eNd as a paleo-circulation tracer.},

	abstract = {Tephrochronology is increasingly being utilised as a key tool for improving chronological models and correlating disparate palaeoclimatic sequences. For many sedimentary environments, however, there is an increased recognition that a range of processes may impart a delay in deposition and/or rework tephra. These processes can affect the integrity of tephra deposits as time-synchronous markers, therefore, it is crucial to assess their isochronous nature, especially when cryptotephras are investigated in a dynamic marine environment. A methodology for the identification and characterisation of marine cryptotephras alongside a protocol for assessing their integrity is outlined. This methodology was applied to a wide network of North Atlantic marine sequences covering the last glacial period. A diverse range of cryptotephra deposits were identified and, based on similarities in physical characteristics (e.g. glass shard concentration profiles and geochemical homogeneity/heterogeneity), indicative of common modes of tephra delivery and post-depositional reworking, a deposit type classification scheme was defined. The presence and dominance of different deposit types within each core allowed an assessment of spatial and temporal controls on tephra deposition and preservation. Overall, isochronous horizons can be identified across a large portion of the North Atlantic due to preferential atmospheric dispersal patterns. However, the variable influence of ice-rafting processes and an interplay between the high eruptive frequency of Iceland and relatively lower sedimentation rates can also create complex tephrostratigraphies in this sector. Sites within a wide sector to the south and east of Iceland have the greatest potential to be repositories for isochronous horizons that can facilitate the synchronisation of palaeoclimatic records.},

Comparison of coexisting species shows: B/Ca of C. wuellerstorfi N C. mundulus N H. elegans N Uvigerina spp., suggestive of strong ``vital effects'' on benthic foraminiferal B/Ca. A dissolution effect on benthic B/Ca is not observed. Core-top data show large intra-species variations (50--130 μmol/mol) in B/Ca. Within a single species, benthic foraminiferal B/Ca show a simple linear correlation with deep water Δ[CO32−], providing a proxy for past deep water [CO32−] reconstructions. Empirical sensitivities of Δ[CO32−] on B/Ca have been established to be 1.14 $\pm$ 0.048 and 0.69 $\pm$ 0.072 μmol/mol per μmol/kg for C. wuellerstorfi and C. mundulus, respectively. The uncertainties associated with reconstructing bottom water Δ[CO32−] using B/Ca in C. wuellerstorfi and C. mundulus are about $\pm$10 μmol/kg. A preliminary application shows that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) B/Ca ratios were increased by 12\% at 1--2 km and decreased by 12\% at 3.5--4.0 km relative to Holocene values in the North Atlantic Ocean. This implies that the LGM [CO32−] was higher by ∼ 25--30 μmol/kg at intermediate depths and lower by ∼ 20 μmol/kg in deeper waters, consistent with glacial water mass reorganization in the North Atlantic Ocean inferred from other paleochemical proxies. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{winnickOxygenIsotopeMassbalance2015,
	abstract = {The mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP, 3.3--2.9 Ma), with reconstructed atmospheric pCO2 of 350--450 ppm, represents a potential analogue for climate change in the near future. Current highly cited estimates place MPWP maximum global mean sea level (GMSL) at 21 $\pm$ 10 m above modern, requiring total loss of the Greenland and marine West Antarctic Ice Sheets and a substantial loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, with only a concurrent 2--3 $\,^{\circ}$C rise in global temperature. Many estimates of Pliocene GMSL are based on the partitioning of oxygen isotope records from benthic foraminifera (d18Ob) into changes in deep-sea temperatures and terrestrial ice sheets. These isotopic budgets are underpinned by the assumption that the d18O of Antarctic ice (d18Oi) was the same in the Pliocene as it is today, and while the sensitivity of d18Ob to changing meltwater d18O has been previously considered, these analyses neglect conservation of 18O/16O in the ocean-ice system. Using well-calibrated d18O-temperature relationships for Antarctic precipitation along with estimates of Pliocene Antarctic surface temperatures, we argue that the d18Oi of the Pliocene Antarctic ice sheet was at minimum 1‰--4‰ higher than present. Assuming conservation of 18O/16O in the ocean-ice system, this requires lower Pliocene seawater d18O without a corresponding change in ice sheet mass. This effect alone accounts for 5\%--20\% of the d18Ob difference between the MPWP interglacials and the modern. With this amended isotope budget, we present a new Pliocene GMSL estimate of 9--13.5 m above modern, which suggests that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is less sensitive to radiative forcing than previously inferred from the geologic record.},

              Earth's environment changed markedly over the past 5.2 million years, when a permanent ice sheet has developed in the Northern Hemisphere and the glacial cycle has changed its period from roughly every 40,000 years to the dominantly 100,000-year duration of the past half-million years. One of the biggest questions about these changes is whether they were ``threshold'' responses to a gradual, uniform cooling trend or whether they represent reactions to discrete episodes of cooling.

Whereas the LPT increase in ice volume is attributed directly to global cooling, the shift to 100,000-year cycles at the MPT is more likely to be a response to an additional change in ice-sheet dynamics.},

@article{mcclymontPliocenePleistoceneEvolution2016,
	abstract = {Over the last 5 million years, the global climate system has evolved toward a colder mean state, marked by large-amplitude oscillations in continental ice volume. Equatorward expansion of polar waters and strengthening temperature gradients have been detected. However, the response of the mid latitudes and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere is not well documented, despite the potential importance for climate feedbacks including sea ice distribution and low-high latitude heat transport. Here we reconstruct the Pliocene-Pleistocene history of both sea surface and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) temperatures on orbital time scales from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 593 in the Tasman Sea, southwest Pacific. We confirm overall Pliocene-Pleistocene cooling trends in both the surface ocean and AAIW, although the patterns are complex. The Pliocene is warmer than modern, but our data suggest an equatorward displacement of the subtropical front relative to present and a poleward displacement of the subantarctic front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Two main intervals of cooling, from {\textasciitilde}3 Ma and {\textasciitilde}1.5 Ma, are coeval with cooling and ice sheet expansion noted elsewhere and suggest that equatorward expansion of polar water masses also characterized the southwest Pacific through the Pliocene-Pleistocene. However, the observed trends in sea surface temperature and AAIW temperature are not identical despite an underlying link to the ACC, and intervals of unusual surface ocean warmth ({\textasciitilde}2 Ma) and large-amplitude variability in AAIW temperatures (from {\textasciitilde}1 Ma) highlight complex interactions between equatorward displacements of fronts associated with the ACC and/or varying poleward heat transport from the subtropics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Climate and environments of the mid-Pliocene warm period (3.264 to 3.025 Ma) have been extensively studied. Whilst numerical models have shed light on the nature of climate at the time, uncertainties in their predictions have not been systematically examined. The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project quantifies uncertainties in model outputs through a coordinated multi-model and multi-model/data intercomparison. Whilst commonalities in model outputs for the Pliocene are clearly evident, we show substantial variation in the sensitivity of models to the implementation of Pliocene boundary conditions. Models appear able to reproduce many regional changes in temperature reconstructed from geological proxies. However, data/model comparison highlights that models potentially underestimate polar amplification. To assert this conclusion with greater confidence, limitations in the time-averaged proxy data currently available must be addressed. Furthermore, sensitivity tests exploring the known unknowns in modelling Pliocene climate specifically relevant to the high latitudes are essential (e.g. palaeogeography, gateways, orbital forcing and trace gasses). Estimates of longer-term sensitivity to CO2 (also known as Earth System Sensitivity; ESS), support previous work suggesting that ESS is greater than Climate Sensitivity (CS), and suggest that the ratio of ESS to CS is between 1 and 2, with a "best" estimate of 1.5.},

	abstract = {Near the PlioceneePleistocene (NeogeneeQuaternary) boundary during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 104 at around 2.6 Ma, the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG) was marked by a southward shift of the North Atlantic Current and Arctic Front and a concurrent drop in sea surface temperature (SST) in the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. Here we evaluate two Mg/Ca-based seasurface temperature reconstructions for the 2.78e2.52 Ma interval using the planktonic foraminifera Globigerina bulloides and Globigerinoides ruber (white) sensu stricto as the biotic carriers (SSTbul and SSTrub), and a reconstruction based on the alkenone saturation index (SSTalk). The Mg/Ca-based SST estimates begin to diverge from one another significantly during MIS G3 ({\textasciitilde}2.66 Ma), culminating during MIS 104 ({\textasciitilde}2.60 Ma), and remaining distinctly different for the remaining 80 kyr of the studied interval. The magnitude of this divergence (DSSTrub-bul) is caused mainly by a decrease in SSTbul, with SSTrub remaining relatively constant. We attribute this difference to a drop in SST during the early-spring blooming season of G. bulloides that was less pronounced during the late-summer blooming season of G. ruber. Using DSSTrub-bul as a seasonality indicator, we show that seasonality increased significantly owing to a drop in early spring temperatures from MIS 104 onwards, and peaked during glacial episodes. Maximum seasonality occurred during MIS 104 in coincidence with a major expansion of the circumAtlantic ice sheets, particularly the North American ice sheet. This expansion appears to have had a critical influence on global climate and especially seasonality.},

            A new finding should improve the ability of climate models to predict the behavior of the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a warmer future. Ford et al. looked at the distribution of surface and subsurface temperatures in the eastern and western equatorial Pacific 19,000 years ago and between 3000 and 6000 years ago. Temperatures fluctuated over a greater range during the older period. ENSO thus depended more on the tilt of the equatorial Pacific thermocline than on the east-to-west temperature gradient, as previously thought.

Paleoclimate records from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) provide insight into ENSO behavior when global boundary conditions (ice sheet extent, atmospheric partial pressure of CO
              2
              ) were different from those today. In this work, we reconstruct LGM temperature variability at equatorial Pacific sites using measurements of individual planktonic foraminifera shells. A deep equatorial thermocline altered the dynamics in the eastern equatorial cold tongue, resulting in reduced ENSO variability during the LGM compared to the Late Holocene. These results suggest that ENSO was not tied directly to the east-west temperature gradient, as previously suggested. Rather, the thermocline of the eastern equatorial Pacific played a decisive role in the ENSO response to LGM climate.},

	abstract = {Earth's climate underwent a major transition from the warmth of the late Pliocene, when global surface temperatures were {\textasciitilde}2$\,^{\circ}$ to 3$\,^{\circ}$C higher than today, to extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) {\textasciitilde}2.73 million years ago (Ma). We show that North Pacific deep waters were substantially colder (4$\,^{\circ}$C) and probably fresher than the North Atlantic Deep Water before the intensification of NHG. At {\textasciitilde}2.73 Ma, the Atlantic-Pacific temperature gradient was reduced to {\textless}1$\,^{\circ}$C, suggesting the initiation of stronger heat transfer from the North Atlantic to the deep Pacific. We posit that increased glaciation of Antarctica, deduced from the 21 $\pm$ 10--meter sea-level fall from 3.15 to 2.75 Ma, and the development of a strong polar halocline fundamentally altered deep ocean circulation, which enhanced interhemispheric heat and salt transport, thereby contributing to NHG.

              When the Antarctic ice sheet began to expand around 3 million years ago, it caused changes in deep ocean circulation, hastening the pace of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. Woodard
              et al.
              analyzed marine sediments from the northwest Pacific Ocean. A substantial fraction of the sea level fall actually occurred before the Northern Hemispheric ice sheets began to grow rapidly, probably because of continental ice growth in Antarctica. Thus, Antarctic glaciers appear to be more dynamic than anticipated, which has implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet in a warming world.

              An essential element of modern ocean circulation and climate is the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which includes deep-water formation in the subarctic North Atlantic. However, a comparable overturning circulation is absent in the Pacific, the world's largest ocean, where relatively fresh surface waters inhibit North Pacific deep convection.

              world of the Pliocene supported subarctic North Pacific deep-water formation and a Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) cell. In Pliocene subarctic North Pacific sediments, we report orbitally paced maxima in calcium carbonate accumulation rate, with accompanying pigment and total organic carbon measurements supporting deep-ocean ventilation-driven preservation as their cause. Together with high accumulation rates of biogenic opal, these findings require vigorous bidirectional communication between surface waters and interior waters down to {\textasciitilde}3 km in the western subarctic North Pacific, implying deep convection. Redox-sensitive trace metal data provide further evidence of higher Pliocene deep-ocean ventilation before the 2.73-Ma (million years) transition. This observational analysis is supported by climate modeling results, demonstrating that atmospheric moisture transport changes, in response to the reduced meridional sea surface temperature gradients of the Pliocene, were capable of eroding the halocline, leading to deep-water formation in the western subarctic Pacific and a strong PMOC. This second Northern Hemisphere overturning cell has important implications for heat transport, the ocean/atmosphere cycle of carbon, and potentially the equilibrium response of the Pacific to global warming.},

These results, when integrated with data from other western North Atlantic locations, indicate that the ocean was poorly ventilated at 4.2 km, with better ventilation above and below that depth. If this is a signal of water mass source and not nutrient storage, it would indicate that a previously unrecognized deep water end member originated along the western margin of the Labrador Sea, analogous to dense water formation today around Antarctica and in the Okhotsk Sea.},

	abstract = {Through transporting heat around the world and thereby regulating global climate, ocean circulation is an in- tegral part of Earth's climate system that likely changed substantially on glacial-interglacial timescales in the deep North Atlantic Ocean. However, quantitative records on deep-water dynamics in the North Atlantic older than {\textasciitilde}1 Myr are sparse and typically of low temporal resolution. Here we provide a new record on northernversus southern-sourced waters in the deep North Atlantic at a yet unprecedented temporal resolution. Our record is based on a novel approach (Atlantic-Pacific bottom-water temperature (BWT) difference) for an interval comprising the onset of larger-scale glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere, the Plio-Pleistocene transition ({\textasciitilde}2.65--2.4 Ma; Marine Isotope Stages G1--95). We thus have generated a new, millennial-scale-resolution BWT record based on benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca from Ocean Drilling Program Site 849 in the East Pacific backed up with a new neodymium-isotope record on glacial-interglacial-scale resolution. The difference between our new BWT record (Site 849) and previously available BWTs from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1313 in the North Atlantic was used to decipher changes between southern- and northern-sourced waters in the deep North Atlantic. In accordance with previous studies, we document an increased influence of deep waters from high southern latitudes during glacials at the expense of northern-sourced waters. Perhaps even more importantly, our new record is highly relevant for the determination of geochemically-based sea-level records from the deep North Atlantic, which was yet limited by quantitative estimates of deep-water masses at a sufficient, (sub-)millennialscale resolution.},

	abstract = {Eight- to ten-point depth profiles (from 1200 to 4800 m water depth) of oxygen and carbon isotopic values derived from benthic foraminifera, averaged over selected times in the past 160 ka, are presented. The data are from 10 sediment cores off eastern New Zealand, mainly North Chatham Rise. This lies under the Deep Western Boundary Current in the Southwest Pacific and is the main point of entry for several water masses into the Pacific Ocean. The benthic isotopic profiles are related to the structure of water masses at present and inferred for the past. These have retained a constant structure of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water--Upper Circumpolar Deep Water/North Pacific Deep Water--Antarctic Intermediate Water with no apparent changes in the depths of water mass boundaries between glacial and interglacial states. Sortable silt particle size data for four cores are also examined to show that the vigour of the inflow to the Pacific, while variable, appears to have remained fairly constant on average. Among the lowest Last Glacial Maximum values of benthic d13C in the world ocean ({\`A}1.03\& based on Cibicidoides wu¨llerstorfi) occurs here at w2200 m. Comparable values occur in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, while those from the rest of the Pacific are distinctly higher, confirming that the Southern Ocean was the source for the unventilated/nutrient-enriched water seen here. Oxygen and carbon isotopic data are compatible with a glacial cold deep water mass of high salinity, but lower nutrient content (or better ventilated), below w3500 m depth. This contrasts with the South Atlantic where unventilated/nutrient-enriched water extends all the way to the sea bed. Comparison with previous studies also suggests that the deeper reaches of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current below w3500 m are not homogeneous all around the Southern Ocean, with the Kerguelen Plateau and/or the Macquarie-Balleny Ridges posing barriers to the eastward spread of the deepest low-d13C water out of the South Atlantic in glacials. These barriers, combined with inferred high density of bottom waters, restricted inter-basin exchange and allow three glacial domains dominated by bottom waters from Weddell Sea, Adelie Coast and Ross Sea to be defined. We suggest that the Ross Sea was the main source of the deep water entering the Pacific below w3500 m.},

The rise implies a rise in flow strength, coeval with a long-term rise in both west Mediterranean Sea surface salinity by almost 2 psu and average bottom water salinity (BWS) by {\textasciitilde}1 psu, despite inherent uncertainties in BWS estimates. The changes were linked with major Mediterranean aridification and a drop in African monsoon humidity. In contrast to model expectations, the rise in MOW salt discharge after 3.4 Ma did not translate into improved ventilation of North Atlantic Deep Water, since it possibly was too small to significantly influence Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Right after {\textasciitilde} 2.95 Ma, with the onset of major Northern Hemisphere Glaciation, long-term average bottom water temperature (BWT) and BWS at Site 548 dropped abruptly by {\textasciitilde}5 $\,^{\circ}$C and {\textasciitilde}1--2 psu, in contrast to more distal Site 982, where BWT and BWS continued to oscillate at estimates of {\textasciitilde}2 $\,^{\circ}$C and 1.5--2.5 psu higher than today until {\textasciitilde}2.6 Ma.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The global climate has been dominated by glacial--interglacial variations since the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation 2.7 million years ago. Although the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has exerted strong influence on recent climatic changes, there is controversy over its influence on Northern Hemisphere glaciation because its deep limb, North Atlantic Deep Water, was thought to have weakened. Here we show that Northern Hemisphere glaciation was amplified by the intensified Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, based on multi-proxy records from the subpolar North Atlantic. We found that the Iceland--Scotland Overflow Water, contributing North Atlantic Deep Water, significantly increased after 2.7 million years ago and was actively maintained even in early stages of individual glacials, in contrast with late stages when it drastically decreased because of iceberg melting. Probably, the active Nordic Seas overturning during the early stages of glacials facilitated the efficient growth of ice sheets and amplified glacial oscillations.},

              similar to early twenty-first century values, the cause of Mid-Pliocene warmth remains elusive. Understanding the behaviour of the North Atlantic Ocean during the Mid-Pliocene is integral to evaluating future climate scenarios owing to its role in deep water formation and its sensitivity to climate change. Under the framework of the Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) sea surface reconstruction, we synthesize Mid-Pliocene North Atlantic studies by PRISM members and others, describing each region of the North Atlantic in terms of palaeoceanography. We then relate Mid-Pliocene sea surface conditions to expectations of future warming. The results of the data and climate model comparisons suggest that the North Atlantic is more sensitive to climate change than is suggested by climate model simulations, raising the concern that estimates of future climate change are conservative.},

@article{druryReinforcingNorthAtlantic2018,
	abstract = {Abstract. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 982 represents a key location for understanding the evolution of climate in the North Atlantic over the past 12 Ma. However, concerns exist about the validity and robustness of the underlying stratigraphy and astrochronology, which currently limits the adequacy of this site for high-resolution climate studies. To resolve this uncertainty, we verify and extend the early Pliocene to late Miocene shipboard composite splice at Site 982 using high-resolution XRF core scanning data and establish a robust high-resolution benthic foraminiferal stable isotope stratigraphy and astrochronology between 8.0 and 4.5 Ma. Splice revisions and verifications resulted in  ∼  11 m of gaps in the original Site 982 isotope stratigraphy, which were filled with 263 new isotope analyses. This new stratigraphy reveals previously unseen benthic δ18O excursions, particularly prior to 6.65 Ma. The benthic δ18O record displays distinct, asymmetric cycles between 7.7 and 6.65 Ma, confirming that high-latitude climate is a prevalent forcing during this interval. An intensification of the 41 kyr beat in both the benthic δ13C and δ18O is also observed  ∼  6.4 Ma, marking a strengthening in the cryosphere--carbon cycle coupling. A large  ∼  0.7 ‰ double excursion is revealed  ∼  6.4--6.3 Ma, which also marks the onset of an interval of average higher δ18O and large precession and obliquity-dominated δ18O excursions between 6.4 and 5.4 Ma, coincident with the culmination of the late Miocene cooling. The two largest benthic δ18O excursions  ∼  6.4--6.3 Ma and TG20/22 coincide with the coolest alkenone-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates from Site 982, suggesting a strong connection between the late Miocene global cooling, and deep-sea cooling and dynamic ice sheet expansion. The splice revisions and revised astrochronology resolve key stratigraphic issues that have hampered correlation between Site 982, the equatorial Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Comparisons of the revised Site 982 stratigraphy to high-resolution astronomically tuned benthic δ18O stratigraphies from ODP Site 926 (equatorial Atlantic) and Ain el Beida (north-western Morocco) show that prior inconsistencies in short-term excursions are now resolved. The identification of key new cycles at Site 982 further highlights the requirement for the current scheme for late Miocene marine isotope stages to be redefined. Our new integrated deep-sea benthic stable isotope stratigraphy and astrochronology from Site 982 will facilitate future high-resolution late Miocene to early Pliocene climate research.},

	abstract = {A continuous 3.5 Myr IRD record was produced from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 907. A timescale based on magnetic polarity chrons, oxygen isotope stratigraphy (for the last 1Myr) and orbital tuning was developed. The record documents a stepwise inception of large-scale glacial cycles in the Nordic Seas region, the first being a marked expansion of the Greenland ice sheet at 3.3 Ma. A second step occurred at 2.74 Ma by an expansion of large scale ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Ice sheet variability around the Nordic Seas was tightly coupled to global ice volume over the past 3.3 Myr. Between 3 and 1 Ma, most of the variance of the IRD signal is in the 41 kyr band, whereas the last 1 Myr is characterized by stronger 100 kyr variance. The Gamma Ray Porosity Evaluator (GRAPE) density record is closely linked with IRD variations and documents sub orbital variability resembling the late Quaternary Heinrich/Bond cycles.},

	abstract = {Recognition and interpretation of paleoclimate signals in sedimentary proxy datasets are time consuming and subjective. Acycle is a comprehensive and easy-to-use software package for time series analysis in paleoclimate research and education. It is designed to speed paleoclimate time series analysis, especially cyclostratigraphy, and to provide objective methods for estimating astrochronology. Acycle provides for detrending with multiple options to track and remove secular trends. A selection of power spectral analysis methodologies is offered for the detection of periodic signals. Many of the functions are specific to cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology that are not found in standard statistical packages. A specialized function is provided to assess the astronomical (Milankovitch) forcing of paleoclimate series and search for the most likely sedimentation rate by evaluating the correlation coefficient between power spectra of an astronomical solution and sedimentary proxy data. Sedimentary noise modeling (for past sea-level changes) is also provided in Acycle. As an example, Acycle is applied to a sedimentary proxy series from the cyclostratigraphy of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) in Core BH9/05 from the Paleogene Central Basin, Svalbard. Acycle detects significant astronomical forcing in the proxy series and relatively stable sedimentation rates during and after the PETM. Acycle runs in the MATLAB environment or as stand-alone software on Windows and Macintosh OS X, and is open-source software.},

@article{gandyExploringIngredientsRequired2019,
	abstract = {Ice stream evolution is a major uncertainty in projections of the future of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice sheets. Accurate simulation of ice stream evolution requires an understanding of a number of ``ingredients'' that control the location and behaviour of ice stream flow. Here, we test the influence of geothermal heat flux, grid resolution, and bed hydrology on simulated ice streaming. The palaeo-record provides snapshots of ice stream evolution, with a particularly well constrained ice sheet being the British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS). We implement a new basal sliding scheme coupled with thermo-mechanics into the BISICLES ice sheet model, to simulate the evolution of the BIIS ice streams. We find that the simulated location and spacing of ice streams matches well with the empirical reconstructions of ice stream flow in terms of position and direction when simple bed hydrology is included. We show that the new basal sliding scheme allows the accurate simulation for the majority of BIIS ice streams. The extensive empirical record of the BIIS has allowed the testing of model inputs, and has helped demonstrate the skill of the ice sheet model in simulating the evolution of the location, spacing, and migration of ice streams through millennia. Simulated ice streams also prompt new empirical mapping of features indicative of streaming in the North Channel region. Ice sheet model development has allowed accurate simulation of the palaeo record, and allows for improved modelling of future ice stream behaviour.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large datasets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example, in genetics as we analyze larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimizing a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalized likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost, which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favorably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies, we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the binary segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.

The record has high resolution due to high mean sedimentation rates (11.3 cm/kyr for the Brunhes Chron and 5.5 cm/kyr for the Matuyama Chron), paleomagnetic measurements every 1 cm along u-channel samples, and high quality isotopic age control. The Iceland Basin Event is manifest by virtual geomagnetic poles crossing the equator at ∼190 ka. The base of the recovered section lies immediately below the Cobb Mountain Subchronozone that occurs within marine isotope stage 35. Normalized remanence data can be correlated to paleointensity records from ODP Sites 983 and 984 (∼700 km to the NW from Site 980) and with lower resolution paleointensity data from the Pacific Ocean. Differences between the Site 980 paleointensity record and the Pacific records are attributed to variable sedimentation rates, variable quality age control, and inadequacies in the normalization procedure used to derive the paleointensity proxies.},

	abstract = {We present a high-resolution climate record from a sediment core spanning an 80-kyr interval of time during the mid-Pliocene epoch, when warmer conditions and lower global ice volume prevailed worldwide. Oxygen and carbon isotope analyses were made on benthic and planktonic foraminifera from ODP Site 981 in the North Atlantic. The amplitude and approximate recurrence interval of suborbital variations in these records are comparable to those of Holocene and marine isotope stage 11 (MIS 11) records from the North Atlantic. We conclude that the mid-Pliocene warm interval was a time of relative climatic stability. These results suggest that warmer climatic conditions alone may not necessarily enhance variability in the climate system, a finding that may facilitate predictions of 21st century climatic response to anthropogenic warming.},

During glacial intervals, significant increases in intermediate-to-deep δ13C gradients (commonly reaching {\textgreater}1.2‰) are consistent with changes in deep water circulation and associated chemical stratification. Bathymetric δ13C gradients covary with benthic foraminiferal δ18O and covary inversely with Vostok CO2, in agreement with chemical stratification as a driver of atmospheric CO2 changes. Three deep circulation indices based on δ13C show a phasing similar to North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, consistent with a Northern Hemisphere control of NADW/SOW variations. However, lags in the precession band indicate that factors other than deep water circulation control ice volume variations at least in this band.},

@article{huybersDepthderivedPleistoceneAge2004,
	abstract = {A new chronology of glaciation, spanning the last 780,000 years, is estimated from 21 marine sediment cores using depth as a proxy for time. To avoid biasing this ``depth-derived'' age estimate, the depth scale is first corrected for the effects of sediment compaction. To provide age uncertainty estimates, the spatial and temporal variability of marine sediment accumulation rates are estimated and modeled as an autocorrelated stochastic process. Depth-derived ages are estimated to be accurate to within $\pm$9000 years, and within this uncertainty are consistent with the orbitally tuned age estimates. Nonetheless, the remaining differences between the depth and orbitally tuned chronologies produce important differences in the spectral domain. From the δ18O record, using the depth-derived ages, we infer that there are weak nonlinearities involving the 100 kyr and obliquity frequency bands which generate interaction bands at sum and difference frequencies. If an orbitally tuned age model is instead applied, these interactions are suppressed, with the system appearing more nearly linear.},

@article{naafsWarmingSurfaceWaters2013,
	abstract = {During the six Heinrich events of the last 70 kyr, episodic calving from the circum-Atlantic ice sheets released large numbers of icebergs into the North Atlantic. These icebergs and associated meltwater flux are hypothesized to have led to a shutdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and severe cooling in large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to the limited availability of high-resolution records, the magnitude of sea surface temperature (SST) changes related to the impact of Heinrich events on the midlatitude North Atlantic is poorly constrained. Here we present a record of -based SSTs derived from sediments of Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Site U1313, located at the southern end of the ice-rafted debris (IRD) belt in the midlatitude North Atlantic (41$\,^{\circ}$N). We demonstrate that all six Heinrich events are associated with a rapid warming of surface waters by 2--4$\,^{\circ}$C in a few thousand years. The presence of IRD leaves no doubt about the simultaneous timing and correlation between rapid surface water warming and Heinrich events. We argue that this warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic is related to a northward expansion of the subtropical gyre during Heinrich events. As a wide range of studies demonstrated that in the central IRD belt Heinrich events are associated with low SSTs, these results thus identify an antiphased (seesaw) pattern in SSTs during Heinrich events between the midlatitude (warm) and northern North Atlantic (cold). This highlights the complex response of surface water characteristics in the North Atlantic to Heinrich events that is poorly reproduced by freshwater hosing experiments and challenges the widely accepted view that, within the IRD belt of the North Atlantic, Heinrich events coincide with periods of low SSTs.},

A high-resolution, reflectance-based age model for these sediments derived from an orbitally tuned age model for western equatorial Atlantic, Ceara Rise sediments was generated by spectral frequency mapping. Power spectra of the Feni Drift record indicate statistically significant sub-Milankovitch cyclicity at 7.6--8.4 and 4.8--6.1 kyr. We infer that these ∼8 and ∼5 kyr cycles document a linkage between North and equatorial Atlantic climate given our ability to correlate these records. These climate cycles influence Atlantic basin carbonate prior to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and thus must arise from some portion of the climate system other than the dynamics of large ice sheets. The presence of these peaks, which could be related to equatorial clipped precession, implies a possible non-linear response to Milankovitch forcing.},

@article{wuEvaluatingZrRb2020,
	abstract = {The ln(Zr/Rb) count ratio derived from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning holds potential as a high-resolution tracer for grain-size variations of glaciomarine sediments, and hence current strength. To evaluate this approach, we conducted high-resolution grain-size measurements, together with Rb and Zr measurements by XRF core scanning and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), on a series of sediment cores from different regions of the Southern Ocean. Downcore changes of the ln(Zr/Rb) count ratio from XRF core scanning are consistent with Zr/Rb concentration ratios derived from ICP-MS analyses, even though Rb and Zr counts deviate significantly from concentrations due to specimen and matrix effects. The ln(Zr/Rb) count ratio displays discrepancies with the bulk mean grain-size, but correlates well with the mean grain-size of the sediment fractions that do not include unsorted sand delivered by ice-rafting. These observations are supported by evidence from a grain-size separation experiment, which indicates that Zr and Rb are concentrated in different grain-size fractions. Consistent with its lack of sensitivity to coarse grain-size fractions derived from ice-rafting, the ln(Zr/ Rb) ratio records similar trends to the sortable silt percent (SS\%) and sortable silt mean (SS) grain-size. Universal gradients exist in plots of SS\% versus ln(Zr/Rb), and SS versus ln(Zr/Rb), such that the ln(Zr/ Rb) ratio provides a convenient way to estimate the magnitude of changes in SS\% and SS. Overall, our results support the use of the ln(Zr/Rb) ratio as an indicator of bottom current strength in cases where the sediment is current-sorted.},

@article{sherwinDeepDriversMesoscale2015,
	abstract = {Mesoscale variability in the central Rockall Trough, immediately west of the British Isles, has been investigated using a combination of ship-borne, underwater glider and gridded satellite altimeter measurements. Altimeter observations show that eddies and large-scale circulation cells are ubiquitous phenomena. They have horizontal length scales of order 100 km with vertical scales of over 1000 m and are associated with mean current speeds (over the upper 1000 m) of 15$\pm$7 cm s−1. Monthly area averaged surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) has substantial inter-annual variability, which at times can dominate a mean seasonal signal that varies from a maximum in May (74 cm2 s−2) to a minimum in October (52 cm2 s−2) and has increased gradually since 1992 at about 1.1 cm2 s−2 per year. This increase may be related to the retreat of the sub-polar gyre (SPG). A 5 month glider mission in the trough showed that the cyclonic component of EKE came from cold water features that are located over 1000 m below the surface. The surface currents from altimeters had similar magnitude to the drift currents averaged over 1000 m from the glider in the stratified autumn, but were half the deep water speed during late winter. Although the mesoscale features move in an apparent random manner, they seem to be constrained by submarine topography such as seamounts. Occasionally anti-cyclonic and cyclonic cells combine to cause a coherent westward deflection of the European slope current that warms the Rockall side of the trough. Such deflections contribute to the interannual variability in the observed temperature and salinity that are monitored in the upper 800 m of the trough. By combining glider and altimeter measurements it is shown that altimeter measurements fail to observe a 15 cm s−1 northward flowing slope current on the eastern side as well as a small persistent southward current on the western side. There is much to be gained from the synergy between satellite altimetry and in situ glider observations.},

The bioturbation index is generally low, from no bioturbation, to 30\% of total bioturbated surface. Significant variations in composition, diversity and abundance of trace fossils are recorded, associated with the dual nature of H1 (comprising H1.1 and H1.2) and the period intervening between the two. Bottom- and pore-water oxygenation and benthic food availability are found to be the main limiting conditions for the tracemaker community, with some variations during the time span of H1, while factors such as sea water temperature had a minor impact.},

@article{newAspectsCirculationRockall2001,
	abstract = {An investigation is made of the circulation and structure of the water masses in the Rockall Trough in spring, combining the results of a recent synoptic survey (May 1998) with those from a high-resolution ocean circulation model. In the near-surface layer, saline flows are carried northwards by a ``Shelf Edge Current'' around the eastern slopes, possibly with some branching in the northern Trough. Fresher waters from the west inflow between 52 and 538N and partially mix with these saline flows in the southern Trough, so that waters of intermediate salinity are also swept northwards. In the southern approaches to the Trough, Labrador Sea Water (LSW) also flows strongly in from the west between 52 and 538N, and while much of this turns south, a proportion penetrates north to join a cyclonic gyre in the Trough extending to 56.58N. The northwestern limb of this gyre is fed by, and mixes with, more saline waters which result from overflows across the Wyville--Thomson Ridge. Furthermore, salinity and CFC data suggest episodic inflow of LSW into the central Trough. The circulation of the North East Atlantic Deep Water in the Trough follows a cyclonic pattern similar to, and lying below, that of the LSW. The Wyville--Thomson Ridge overflows in the model extend to higher densities than in the survey, are topographically steered southwestward down the Feni Ridge system, and eventually join a deep cyclonic circulation in the North East Atlantic basin. Overall, the model and the observations are in good agreement, particularly in the central Rockall Trough, and this has allowed conclusions to be drawn which are significantly more robust than those which would result from either the survey or the model alone. In particular, we have been able to infer cyclonic circulation pathways for the intermediate and deeper waters in the Rockall Trough for (we believe) the first time. The study has also contributed to an ongoing community effort to assess the realism of, and improve, our current generation of ocean circulation models. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{mccaveDistinguishingCurrentEffects2019,
	abstract = {There are climatically important ocean flow systems in high latitudes, for example the East and West Greenland and Labrador Currents and Nordic Sea overflows in the North, and Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the South, for which it would be useful to know history of flow strength. Most of the sediment records under these flows contain evidence of supply from glacial sources, which has led to the supposition that fine sediment records, which in other settings provide evidence of vigour of flow from the sortable silt proxy, are fatally contaminated by unsorted glacial silt. It is suggested here that if the fine fraction ({\textless}63 mm) has been transported and sorted, then it does not matter that it may have been released from icebergs, sea ice or meltwater plumes. Here we show that correlation between sortable silt mean and percentage provides a good indicator of whether a fine sediment record has been sufficiently well current-sorted to provide a reliable flow history. The running downcore correlation (rrun) (5 to 9point depending on sampling interval) is found to be optimal, and a value of rrun {\textless} 0.5 is proposed as an indicator of sufficiently poor sorting to invalidate a section of mean size record. More than 40 grainsize records determined by laser particle sizers from over 30 core sites have been processed and examined for evidence of sorting. As expected, there is a tendency for poor sorting and unreliable records at points where the flow speed has decreased to very low values. There is no consistent relationship between the sorting of the fine fraction and the content of coarse ice-rafted debris (as long as the IRD fraction is not {\textgreater} 50\%) because the two are not related. End member (EM) decomposition of several records yields variable results in terms of the relationship between EM ratios and grainsize parameters. Although such an approach can generate fine sediment parameters it does not provide a basis for deciding whether or not a record is acceptably current sorted and thus contains a valid flow speed proxy. Our proposed discrimination between current-sorted and unsorted fine fractions is applicable to all fine grained deposits, not only high-latitude deposits with coarse IRD.},

	abstract = {Abrupt changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (comprising northward flow of warm water and a cold southward return flow) are implicated in abrupt climate changes in the late Pleistocene. A sensitive place to assess this circulation is in the cold return flow of Deep Western Boundary Currents. Here, in records of flow speed and isotopic composition of surface and bottom waters from a Deep Western Boundary Current location near the northern source of North Atlantic Deep Water, we show both orbital and millennial-scale coupling between deep ocean flow and climate in the middle Pleistocene (0.75--0.87 Ma), when the boundary conditions in terms of the mean state and amplitude of climate change were different from more recent periods. The coupling appears as a phased series of events initiated by reduced vertical density gradients and initial ventilation of deep waters. The occurrence of these events in interglacials during the middle Pleistocene suggests that the millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic was more pronounced at that time than previously thought. This demonstrates that, given the right boundary conditions, rapid climate shifts can also occur during relatively warm climate conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The global ocean--climate system has been highly sensitive to the formation and advection of deep overflow water from the Nordic Seas as integral part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) but its evolution over the Pliocene--Pleistocene global cooling is not fully understood. In particular, changes in the sources and mixing of prevailing deep waters that were involved in driving overturning throughout the Pliocene--Pleistocene climate transitions are not well constrained. Here we investigate the evolution of a substantial deep southward return overflow of the AMOC over the last 4 million years. We present new records of the bottom-water radiogenic neodymium isotope (\&amp;varepsilon;Nd) variability obtained from three sediment cores (DSDP site 610 and ODP sites 980/981 and 900) at water depths between 2170 and 5050 m in the northeast Atlantic. We find that prior to the onset of major Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) ∼3 million years ago (Ma), \&amp;varepsilon;Nd values primarily oscillated between −9 and −11 at all sites, consistent with enhanced vertical mixing and weak stratification of the water masses during the warmer-than-today Pliocene period. From 2.7 Ma to ∼2.0 Ma, the \&amp;varepsilon;Nd signatures of the water masses gradually became more distinct, which documents a significant advection of Nordic Seas overflow deep water coincident with the intensification of NHG. Most markedly, however, at ∼1.6 Ma the interglacial \&amp;varepsilon;Nd signatures at sites 610 (2420 m water depth (w.d.)) and 980/981 (2170 m w.d.) synchronously and permanently shifted by 2 to 3 \&amp;varepsilon;Nd units to less radiogenic values, respectively. Since then the difference between glacial and interglacial \&amp;varepsilon;Nd values has been similar to the Late Quaternary at each site. A decrease of ∼2\&amp;varepsilon;Nd units at 1.6 Ma was also recorded for the deepest water masses by site 900 (∼5050 m w.d.), which thereafter, however, evolved to more radiogenic values again until the present. This major \&amp;varepsilon;Nd change across the 1.6 Ma transition reflects a significant reorganization of the overturning circulation in the northeast Atlantic paving the way for the more stratified water column with distinct water masses prevailing thereafter.},

@article{johnsonWyvilleThomsonRidge2010,
	abstract = {Wyville Thomson Ridge Overflow Water (WTOW), which is the only part of the outflow from the Norwegian Sea not to directly enter the Iceland Basin, is shown to be a significant water mass in the northern Rockall Trough. It is found primarily at intermediate depths (600--1200 m) beneath the northward flowing warm Atlantic waters, and above recirculating Mediterranean influenced waters and Labrador Sea Water (LSW). The bottom of the WTOW layer can be identified by a mid-depth inflexion point in potential temperature--salinity plots. An analysis of historical data reveals that WTOW has been present in all but eight of the last 31 years at 57.51N in the Rockall Trough. A denser component of WTOW below 1500 m has also been present, although it appears to be less persistent (12 out of the 31 years) and limited to the west of the section. The signature of intermediate WTOW was absent in two periods, the mid-1980s and early 1990s, both of which coincided with a freshening, and probable increase in volume, of LSW in the trough. Potential temperature--salinity diagrams from historical observations indicate that WTOW persists at least as far south as 551N (and as far west as 201W in the Iceland Basin) although its signature is quickly lost on leaving the Rockall Trough. We suggest that a transport of WTOW down the western side of the trough exists, with WTOW at intermediate depths entering the eastern trough either via a cyclonic recirculation, or as a result of eddy activity. Further, WTOW is seen on the Rockall--Hatton Plateau and in the deep channels connecting with the Iceland Basin, suggesting additional possible WTOW transport pathways. These suggested transport routes remain to be confirmed by further observational or modelling studies.},

Mean speeds within this overflow are 10--15 cm s−1 giving a transport time from the Wyville Thomson Ridge to the central basin of {\textless} 50 days. Analysis of the 40-year Extended Ellett Line record shows proportions of Norwegian Sea Deep Water associated with the deep core exceed 15\% around one quarter of the time. We present the first transport estimates for overflow water in the Rockall Trough. This flux is for overflow water modified by mixing with a density greater than 27.65 kg m−3. Mean values calculated both from a newly deployed mooring array (OSNAP project) and indirectly from the Extended Ellett Line time-series are −0.3 $\pm$ 0.04 Sv. Although the flux is highly variable there is no long term trend. As some overflow appears to exit into the Iceland Basin via channels between the northern banks, we suggest that the volume transport will likely increase as the flow pathway is traced back around the boundary of the Rockall Trough towards the Wyville Thomson Ridge.},

A composite chronology is constructed using: (i) the benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope record, matched to an orbitally tuned stacked record of global ice volume (SPECMAP); (ii) the synchronisation of the planktonic foraminiferal (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral)) and ITRAX XRF Ca records to the Greenland ice core (NGRIP) back to ca. 123 ka; and (iii) the synchronisation of the same N. pachyderma (sinistral)) and ITRAX XRF Ca records to the atmospheric methane record of the Antarctic ice core (EPICA Dome C) beyond 123 ka. The first offshore evidence for the expansion of the last BIS within MIS 4 is presented, suggesting extensive glaciation of northwestern Britain during the Devensian/Weichselian as early as 70 ka. The proximity of this long sediment core to the glaciated margin of northwestern Scotland makes it ideal to capture the ice-rafted debris (IRD) signal of the BIS for the last 175 ka, via a continuous flux record of IRD.

The cooling episodes associated with the drastic Heinrich events are related to large reductions of deep-water formation and a northward migration of 13C depleted southern source deep waters to 621N in the North Atlantic Ocean. The inter-Heinrich events which are correlated to the other cold stadials, are marked by significant changes of sea surface temperature around the Rockall Plateau, variations in the flux of icebergs to the North Atlantic Ocean but are not associated with such important reduction of deep-water formation.

@article{barkerStrengtheningAtlanticInflow2021,
	abstract = {The development of larger and longer lasting northern hemisphere ice sheets during the mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) coincided with global cooling. Here, we show that surface waters of the north-eastern Atlantic actually warmed across this interval (∼1.2--0.8 Ma), which we argue reflects an increase in the north-eastward transport of heat and moisture via the North Atlantic Current (NAC) into the Nordic Seas (the Atlantic Inflow). We suggest that simultaneous cooling and warming along the northwestern and south-eastern margins (respectively) of the NAC during Marine Isotope Stage 28 (∼995 ka) reflected the increasing persistence of northern ice sheets as Atlantic Inflow increased. This resulted in a diachronous shift from ∼40 to ∼100 kyr cyclicity across the North East (NE) Atlantic as the growing influence of northern ice sheets spread southwards; to the north-west of the NAC the first ``100 kyr'' cycle preceded Termination 12 (∼960 ka), while on the south-eastern margin of the NAC the transition occurred ∼100 kyr later. Exploratory climate model simulations suggest that increasing Atlantic Inflow at this time could have accelerated ice sheet growth because pre-existing moderately sized ice sheets allowed the positive effect of increasing precipitation to outpace melting. In addition, we propose that the dependence of post-MPT ice sheets on moisture transport via the Atlantic Inflow may ultimately contribute to their apparent vulnerability to insolation forcing once a critical size threshold is crossed and high latitude ice sheets become starved of a vital moisture source.},

	abstract = {A major change in the North Atlantic pattern of ice-rafting deposition, during the last interglacial-glacial cycle, occurred approximately 75,000 B.P. Prior to this time, deposition for a period of almost 50,000 yr during isotopic stage 5 was greatest in the northwest near Greenland and Newfoundland. The main glacial pattern was very different; the main depositional axis shifted abruptly to a zonal axis along lat 46$\,^{\circ}$ to 50$\,^{\circ}$N, reflecting the passage of ice farther from the pole before reaching water warm enough in which to melt. This pattern remained essentially unchanged for 65,000 yr during the main W{\"u}rm glaciation.The peak interglacial depositional pattern can best be explained by analogy with the modern oceanic flow, except for the addition of a concentrated eastward component along lat 50$\,^{\circ}$N. The glacial pattern is also best explained by counterclockwise flow. Laurentide and Greenlandic ice entering the western North Atlantic from the Labrador Sea moved to the east and southeast directly into the glacial depositional maximum. Scandinavian ice dropped part of its bed load near Norway, looped to the southwest into the North Atlantic in a counterclockwise passage south of Iceland, and finally melted along the primary depositional maximum.Total input rates of ice-rafted sediment to the Atlantic and Norwegian Sea increased slightly at 115,000 B.P. (the glacial inception), rose markedly at 75,000 B.P. (the major glacial transition), and continued to rise late in the W{\"u}rm toward the late-glacial maximum. North Atlantic ice-rafting deposition is thus positively correlated with ice-sheet size.During Quaternary time, roughly 70\% of ice-rafted deposition of continental detritus in the world's oceans has occurred in the subpolar North Atlantic south of Iceland. During the past 3 m.y., a mass of wet unconsolidated drift estimated at 200,000 km3 has been moved from the continents to the deep Atlantic by ice-rafting alone. This is equivalent to a layer of drift 16 m thick over all parts of the continents thought to have supplied ice-rafted detritus to the North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {High resolution multibeam swath bathymetric data acquired from the Rockall Bank reveal an abundance of linear to slightly sinuous seabed incisions. These features, interpreted as relict iceberg scours, provide for the first time evidence that the Rockall Bank was intensively scoured by iceberg keels. While the shallower portion of the Rockall Bank lacks evidence of iceberg scouring, on the western and southern flanks (between 250 and 450 m water depth) the seabed is almost completely covered by thousands of cross-cutting scours. More isolated scours, up to 800 m wide and 25 km long are also observed down to nearly 600 m water depth. Based on a full glacial sea level low stand of 120 m, these isolated scour marks must have been carved by gigantic icebergs with keels up to 500 m deep and able to create incisions up to 15 m deep in the seabed. Analysis of scour orientation, length, width, and depth indicates that these mega-icebergs were likely calved from large, fast-flowing ice sheet outlets draining circum-North Atlantic ice sheets. Prevailing scour orientations suggest a number of possible ice sheet sources, including southeast and southern Greenland and the Donegal-Barra ice stream of the last British--Irish Ice Sheet. The bimodal distribution of the scour depth observed across the Rockall Bank suggest either different icebergs provenances or physical and climatic controls on icebergs draft.},

At flow speeds below 10--15 cm s−1 mean grain-size in the terrigenous non-cohesive `sortable silt' range (denoted by SS, mean of 10--63 µm) is controlled by selective deposition, whereas above that range removal of finer material by winnowing is also argued to play a role.},

It is known that the origin of this IRD, especially off Iberia, can vary between North America and western Europe during short-lived episodes of greatly enhanced iceberg flux, known as Heinrich events, although in most Heinrich events the IRD has a North American source. During the longer times of much lower IRD fluxes between Heinrich events, use of an intermediate complexity climate model, coupled to an iceberg dynamic and thermodynamic model, shows that background levels of IRD most likely originate from western Europe, particularly the British--Irish Ice Sheet.

@article{wrightSurfaceDeepOcean2002,
	abstract = {We investigated surface and deep ocean variability in the subpolar North Atlantic from 1000 to 500 thousand years ago (ka) based on two Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites, Feni drift site 980 (55$\,^{\circ}$29′N, 14$\,^{\circ}$42′W) and Bjorn drift site 984 (61$\,^{\circ}$25′N, 24$\,^{\circ}$04′W). Benthic foraminiferal stable isotope data, planktic foraminiferal faunas, ice-rafted debris data, and faunally based sea-surface temperature estimates help test the hypothesis that oceanographic changes in the North Atlantic region were associated with the onset of the 100-kyr world during the mid-Pleistocene revolution. Based on percentage of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (s) records from both sites, surface waters during interglacials and glacials were cooler in the mid-Pleistocene than during marine isotope stages (MIS) 5 and 6. In particular, interglaciations at Bjorn drift site 984 were significantly cooler. Faunal evidence suggests that the interglacial Arctic front shifted from a position between the two sites to a position northwest of Bjorn drift site 984 after ca. 610 ka. As during the late Pleistocene, we find faunal evidence for lagging surface warmth at most of the glacial initiations during the mid-Pleistocene. Each initiation is associated with high benthic δ13C values that are maintained into the succeeding glaciation, which we term ``lagging NADW production.'' These findings indicate that lagging warmth and lagging NADW production are robust features of the regional climate system that persist in the middle to late Pleistocene.},

@article{hodellOxygenCarbonIsotopes2008,
	abstract = {We report oxygen and carbon isotope results of detrital carbonate grains from Heinrich layers at three sites in the North Atlantic located along a transect from the Labrador Sea to the eastern North Atlantic. Oxygen isotopic values of individual detrital carbonate grains from six Heinrich layers at all sites average −5.6‰ $\pm$1.5‰ (1σ; n=166), reflecting values of dolomitic limestone derived from source areas in northeastern Canada. The δ18O of bulk carbonate at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1308 (re-occupation of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 609) in the eastern North Atlantic records the proportion of detrital to biogenic carbonate and δ18O decreases to −5‰ during Heinrich (H) events 1, 2, 4 and 5 relative to a background value of ∼1 to 2‰ for biogenic carbonate. Bulk δ18O also decreases during H3 and H6 but only attains values of −1‰, indicating either a greater proportion of biogenic-to-detrital carbonate or a different source. Because the δ18O of detrital carbonate is ∼9‰ lower than foraminifer carbonate, any fine-grained detrital carbonate not removed from the inner test chambers will lower foraminifer δ18O. We conclude bulk carbonate δ18O is a sensitive proxy for detrital carbonate and may be useful for identifying Heinrich layers in cores within and near the margins of the North Atlantic ice-rafted detritus (IRD) belt.},

@article{hodellReferenceTimeScale2015,
	abstract = {We produced a composite depth scale and chronology for Site U1385 on the SW Iberian Margin. Using log(Ca/Ti) measured by core scanning XRF at 1-cm resolution in all holes, a composite section was constructed to 166.5meter composite depth (mcd) that corrects for stretching and squeezing in each core. Oxygen isotopes of benthic foraminifera were correlated to a stacked δ18O reference signal (LR04) to produce an oxygen isotope stratigraphy and age model. Variations in sediment color contain very strong precession signals at Site U1385, and the amplitude modulation of these cycles provides a powerful tool for developing an orbitally-tuned age model. We tuned the U1385 record by correlating peaks in L* to the local summer insolation maxima at 37$\,^{\circ}$N. The benthic δ18O record of Site U1385, when placed on the tuned age model, generally agrees with other time scales within their respective chronologic uncertainties. The age model is transferred to down-core data to produce a continuous time series of log(Ca/Ti) that reflect relative changes of biogenic carbonate and detrital sediment. Biogenic carbonate increases during interglacial and interstadial climate states and decreases during glacial and stadial periods. Much of the variance in the log(Ca/Ti) is explained by a linear combination of orbital frequencies (precession, tilt and eccentricity), whereas the residual signal reflects suborbital climate variability. The strong correlation between suborbital log(Ca/Ti) variability and Greenland temperature over the last glacial cycle at Site U1385 suggests that this signal can be used as a proxy for millennial-scale climate variability over the past 1.5Ma. Millennial climate variability, as expressed by log(Ca/Ti) at Site U1385, was a persistent feature of glacial climates over the past 1.5Ma, including glacial periods of the early Pleistocene (`41-kyr world') when boundary conditions differed significantly from those of the late Pleistocene (`100-kyr world'). Suborbital variability was suppressed during interglacial stages and enhanced during glacial periods, especially when benthic δ18O surpassed {\textasciitilde}3.3--3.5‰. Each glacial inception was marked by appearance of strong millennial variability and each deglaciation was preceded by a terminal stadial event. Suborbital variability may be a symptomatic feature of glacial climate or, alternatively, may play a more active role in the inception and/or termination of glacial cycles.},

Three intervals have been described based on changes in nannofossil composition and abundance fluctuations of taxa. Reticulofenestrids are abundant just in the first interval (MIS 35--22), which is also characterised by the absence of Gephyrocapsa ({\textgreater}4μm) and C. pelagicus s.l., the latter occurring in upper MIS 24 only. The second interval corresponds to the expanded warm MIS 21 that is accompanied by high carbonate content, absence of both nannofossil reworking and ice rafted debris (IRD), higher abundance of C. leptoporus (5--8μm) and H. carteri, and absence of C. pelagicus s.l. and medium gephyrocapsids. The third interval (MIS 20--15) records the occurrence of C. pelagicus s.l. and medium Gephyrocapsa, generally higher abundance and higher amplitude fluctuations of helicoliths, and absence of reticulofenestrids. The major changes in nannofossil assemblages seem to be the result of combined paleoenvironmental factors related to sea surface water features (temperature and nutrient availability, sea-ice cover) and possibly to deep and intermediate water production of both Northern and Southern Hemisphere origin during glacial and interglacial phases. Complex inter-relationships between environmental parameters and evolutionary/ecological factors are inferred to explain the patterns of Coccolithus pelagicus subspecies, whose distribution and abundance fluctuations are compared with the available patterns of Turborotalia quinqueloba and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (left coiled) at Site 980 and with the C. pelagicus subspecies patterns from North Atlantic DSDP (Deep Sea Drilling Project) Site 607 and South Atlantic ODP Site 1090. Data collected provide additional information on stratigraphic distribution of selected taxa; the First Occurrence (FO) of Gephyrocapsa omega is confirmed as a diachronous event, even in the Atlantic Ocean, while the First and Last Common Occurrence (FCO, LCO) of R. asanoi appear as diachronous and synchronous events, respectively, on a global scale.},

Here we show that red snow, a common algal habitat blooming after the onset of melting, plays a crucial role in decreasing albedo. Our data reveal that red pigmented snow algae are cosmopolitan as well as independent of location-specific geochemical and mineralogical factors. The patterns for snow algal diversity, pigmentation and, consequently albedo, are ubiquitous across the Arctic and the reduction in albedo accelerates snow melt and increases the time and area of exposed bare ice. We estimated that the overall decrease in snow albedo by red pigmented snow algal blooms over the course of one melt season can be 13\%. This will invariably result in higher melt rates. We argue that such a `bio-albedo' effect has to be considered in climate models.},

The rapid termination would have resulted in a warming of the snowball Earth to extreme greenhouse conditions. The transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean would result in the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate in warm surface waters, producing the cap carbonate rocks observed globally.},

@article{pasquierPyriteSulfurIsotopes2017,
	abstract = {The sulfur biogeochemical cycle plays a key role in regulating Earth's surface redox through diverse abiotic and biological reactions that have distinctive stable isotopic fractionations. As such, variations in the sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S) of sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases over Earth history can be used to infer substantive changes to the Earth's surface environment, including the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Such inferences assume that individual δ34S records reflect temporal changes in the global sulfur cycle; this assumption may be well grounded for sulfate-bearing minerals but is less well established for pyrite-based records. Here, we investigate alternative controls on the sedimentary sulfur isotopic composition of marine pyrite by examining a 300-m drill core of Mediterranean sediments deposited over the past 500,000 y and spanning the last five glacial−interglacial periods. Because this interval is far shorter than the residence time of marine sulfate, any change in the sulfur isotopic record preserved in pyrite (δ34Spyr) necessarily corresponds to local environmental changes. The stratigraphic variations ({\textgreater}76‰) in the isotopic data reported here are among the largest ever observed in pyrite, and are in phase with glacial−interglacial sea level and temperature changes. In this case, the dominant control appears to be glacial−interglacial variations in sedimentation rates. These results suggest that there exist important but previously overlooked depositional controls on sedimentary sulfur isotope records, especially associated with intervals of substantial sea level change. This work provides an important perspective on the origin of variability in such records and suggests meaningful paleoenvironmental information can be derived from pyrite δ34S records.},

@article{higginsMineralogyEarlyMarine2018,
	abstract = {Shallow-water carbonate sediments constitute the bulk of sedimentary carbonates in the geologic record and are widely used archives of Earth's chemical and climatic history. One of the main limitations in interpreting the geochemistry of ancient carbonate sediments is the potential for post-depositional diagenetic alteration. In this study, we use paired measurements of calcium (44Ca/40Ca or δ44Ca) and magnesium (26Mg/24Mg or δ26Mg) isotope ratios in sedimentary carbonates and associated pore-fluids as a tool to understand the mineralogical and diagenetic history of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments from the Bahamas and southwest Australia. We find that the Ca and Mg isotopic composition of bulk carbonate sediments at these sites exhibits systematic stratigraphic variability that is related to both mineralogy and early marine diagenesis. The observed variability in bulk sediment Ca isotopes is best explained by changes in the extent and style of early marine diagenesis from one where the composition of the diagenetic carbonate mineral is determined by the chemistry of the fluid (fluid-buffered) to one where the composition of the diagenetic carbonate mineral is determined by the chemistry of the precursor sediment (sediment-buffered). Our results indicate that this process, together with variations in carbonate mineralogy (aragonite, calcite, and dolomite), plays a fundamental and underappreciated role in determining the regional and global stratigraphic expressions of geochemical tracers (δ13C, δ18O, major, minor, and trace elements) in shallow-water carbonate sediments in the geologic record. Our results also provide evidence that a large shallow-water carbonate sink that is enriched in 44Ca can explain the mismatch between the δ44/40Ca value of rivers and deep-sea carbonate sediments and call into question the hypothesis that the δ44/40Ca value of seawater depends on the mineralogy of primary carbonate precipitations (e.g. `aragonite seas' and `calcite seas'). Finally, our results for sedimentary dolomites suggest that paired measurements of Ca and Mg isotopes may provide a unique geochemical fingerprint of mass transfer during dolomitization to better understand the paleo-environmental information preserved in these enigmatic but widespread carbonate minerals.},

@article{stolperModelingEffectsDiagenesis2018,
	abstract = {The measurement of multiply isotopically substituted (`clumped isotope') carbonate groups provides a way to reconstruct past mineral formation temperatures. However, dissolution-reprecipitation (i.e., recrystallization) reactions, which commonly occur during sedimentary burial, can alter a sample's clumped-isotope composition such that it partially or wholly reflects deeper burial temperatures. Here we derive a quantitative model of diagenesis to explore how diagenesis alters carbonate clumped-isotope values. We apply the model to a new dataset from deep-sea sediments taken from Ocean Drilling Project site 807 in the equatorial Pacific. This dataset is used to ground truth the model. We demonstrate that the use of the model with accompanying carbonate clumped-isotope and carbonate δ18O values provides new constraints on both the diagenetic history of deep-sea settings as well as past equatorial sea-surface temperatures. Specifically, the combination of the diagenetic model and data support previous work that indicates equatorial sea-surface temperatures were warmer in the Paleogene as compared to today. We then explore whether the model is applicable to shallow-water settings commonly preserved in the rock record. Using a previously published dataset from the Bahamas, we demonstrate that the model captures the main trends of the data as a function of burial depth and thus appears applicable to a range of depositional settings.},

@article{fantleSrIsotopesPore2006,
	abstract = {The 87Sr/86Sr ratios and Sr concentrations in sediment and pore fluids are used to evaluate the rates of calcite recrystallization at ODP Site 807A on the Ontong Java Plateau, an 800-meter thick section of carbonate ooze and chalk. A numerical model is used to evaluate the pore fluid chemistry and Sr isotopes in an accumulating section. The deduced calcite recrystallization rate is 2\% per million years (\%/Myr) near the top of the section and decreases systematically in older parts of the section such that the rate is close to 0.1/age (in years). The deduced recrystallization rates have important implications for the interpretation of Ca and Mg concentration profiles in the pore fluids. The effect of calcite recrystallization on pore fluid chemistry is described by the reaction length, L, which varies by element, and depends on the concentration in pore fluid and solid. When L is small compared to the thickness of the sedimentary section, the pore fluid concentration is controlled by equilibrium or steady-state exchange with the solid phase, except within a distance L of the sediment--water interface. When L is large relative to the thickness of sediment, the pore fluid concentration is mostly controlled by the boundary conditions and diffusion. The values of L for Ca, Sr, and Mg are of order 15, 150, and 1500 meters, respectively. LSr is derived from isotopic data and modeling, and allows us to infer the values of LCa and LMg. The small value for LCa indicates that pore fluid Ca concentrations, which gradually increase down section, must be equilibrium values that are maintained by solution-precipitation exchange with calcite and do not reflect Ca sources within or below the sediment column. The pore fluid Ca measurements and measured alkalinity allow us to calculate the in situ pH in the pore fluids, which decreases from 7.6 near the sediment--water interface to 7.1$\pm$0.1 at 400--800mbsf. While the calculated pH values are in agreement with some of the values measured during ODP Leg 130, most of the measurements are artifacts. The large value for LMg indicates that the pore fluid Mg concentrations at 807A are not controlled by calcite-fluid equilibrium but instead are determined by the changing Mg concentration of seawater during deposition, modified by aqueous diffusion in the pore fluids. We use the pore fluid Mg concentration profile at Site 807A to retrieve a global record for seawater Mg over the past 35Myr, which shows that seawater Mg has increased rapidly over the past 10Myr, rather than gradually over the past 60Myr. This observation suggests that the Cenozoic rise in seawater Mg is controlled by continental weathering inputs rather than by exchange with oceanic crust. The relationship determined between reaction rate and age in silicates and carbonates is strikingly similar, which suggests that reaction affinity is not the primary determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature.},

@article{fantleCaIsotopesCarbonate2007,
	abstract = {The calcium isotopic compositions (δ44Ca) of 30 high-purity nannofossil ooze and chalk and 7 pore fluid samples from ODP Site 807A (Ontong Java Plateau) are used in conjunction with numerical models to determine the equilibrium calcium isotope fractionation factor (αs−f) between calcite and dissolved Ca2+ and the rates of post-depositional recrystallization in deep sea carbonate ooze. The value of αs−f at equilibrium in the marine sedimentary section is 1.0000$\pm$0.0001, which is significantly different from the value (0.9987$\pm$0.0002) found in laboratory experiments of calcite precipitation and in the formation of biogenic calcite in the surface ocean. We hypothesize that this fractionation factor is relevant to calcite precipitation in any system at equilibrium and that this equilibrium fractionation factor has implications for the mechanisms responsible for Ca isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. We describe a steady state model that offers a unified framework for explaining Ca isotope fractionation across the observed precipitation rate range of ∼14 orders of magnitude. The model attributes Ca isotope fractionation to the relative balance between the attachment and detachment fluxes at the calcite crystal surface. This model represents our hypothesis for the mechanism responsible for isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. The Ca isotope data provide evidence that the bulk rate of calcite recrystallization in freshly-deposited carbonate ooze is 30--40\%/Myr, and decreases with age to about 2\%/Myr in 2--3 million year old sediment. The recrystallization rates determined from Ca isotopes for Pleistocene sediments are higher than those previously inferred from pore fluid Sr concentration and are consistent with rates derived for Late Pleistocene siliciclastic sediments using uranium isotopes. Combining our results for the equilibrium fractionation factor and recrystallization rates, we evaluate the effect of diagenesis on the Ca isotopic composition of marine carbonates at Site 807A. Since calcite precipitation rates in the sedimentary column are many orders of magnitude slower than laboratory experiments and the pore fluids are only slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite, the isotopic composition of diagenetic calcite is likely to reflect equilibrium precipitation. Accordingly, diagenesis produces a maximum shift in δ44Ca of +0.15‰ for Site 807A sediments but will have a larger impact where sedimentation rates are low, seawater circulates through the sediment pile, or there are prolonged depositional hiatuses.},

@article{bradburyCalciumIsotopeFractionation2018,
	abstract = {We present calcium isotope data from pore fluids and solids from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 175: Sites 1081 and 1086 (off the coast of West Africa). These sites are similar with respect to geographic location, sediment age (from modern to 8 Myr), and water depth (800 m), but Site 1081 is carbonate-poor, whereas Site 1086 is carbonate-rich. Therefore, these sites are suited for the exploration of the influence of sediment type on carbonate dissolution, precipitation, and recrystallization. We use two numerical modelling approaches to explore the rates of carbonate dissolution and precipitation in the sediment column. The first is the standard diffusion-reaction approach, using the strontium concentration within the pore fluid to ascertain a dissolution rate for the carbonate, which is then applied to a second model of calcium isotopes within the pore fluid to calculate precipitation rates. Given the high sedimentation rates we also apply an advection-reaction model (Huber et al., 2017) which results in the same depth distribution of carbonate precipitation but significantly higher overall rates, which is discussed. Calcium isotope ratios in pore fluid calcium increase in zones where our model predicts carbonate precipitation, and approach isotopic equilibrium with the solid in zones where our model predicts equivalent rates of dissolution and precipitation, similar to previous findings. Contrary to previous findings in marine sediments, our model requires a calcium isotope fractionation on carbonate precipitation to fit the data, as there is an offset between the δ44Ca of the fluid and the solid. Using the zones of carbonate precipitation determined from the models and previously published carbon isotope profiles of the dissolved inorganic carbon from these sites, we suggest that the δ13C of the authigenic carbonate is uniformly lower than biogenic carbonate but by a wider range than was previously suggested.},

@article{higginsConstrainingMagnesiumCycling2010,
	abstract = {Magnesium concentrations in deep-sea sediment pore-fluids typically decrease down core due to net precipitation of dolomite or clay minerals in the sediments or underlying crust. To better characterize and differentiate these processes, we have measured magnesium isotopes in pore-fluids and sediment samples from Ocean Drilling Program sites (1082, 1086, 1012, 984, 1219, and 925) that span a range of oceanographic settings. At all sites, magnesium concentrations decrease with depth. At sites where diagenetic reactions are dominated by the respiration of organic carbon, pore-fluid δ26Mg values increase with depth by as much as 2‰. Because carbonates preferentially incorporate 24Mg (low δ26Mg), the increase in pore-fluid δ26Mg values at these sites is consistent with the removal of magnesium in Mg-carbonate (dolomite). In contrast, at sites where the respiration of organic carbon is not important and/or weatherable minerals are abundant, pore-fluid δ26Mg values decrease with depth by up to 2‰. The decline in pore-fluid δ26Mg at these sites is consistent with a magnesium sink that is isotopically enriched relative to the pore-fluid. The identity of this enriched magnesium sink is likely clay minerals. Using a simple 1D diffusion--advection--reaction model of pore-fluid magnesium, we estimate rates of net magnesium uptake/removal and associated net magnesium isotope fractionation factors for sources and sinks at all sites. Independent estimates of magnesium isotope fractionation during dolomite precipitation from measured δ26Mg values of dolomite samples from sites 1082 and 1012 are very similar to modeled net fractionation factors at these sites, suggesting that local exchange of magnesium between sediment and pore-fluid at these sites can be neglected. Our results indicate that the magnesium incorporated in dolomite is 2.0--2.7‰ depleted in δ26Mg relative to the precipitating fluid. Assuming local exchange of magnesium is minor at the rest of the studied sites, our results suggest that magnesium incorporated into clay minerals is enriched in δ26Mg by 0‰ to +1.25‰ relative to the precipitating fluid. This work demonstrates the utility of magnesium isotopes as a tracer for magnesium sources/sinks in low-temperature aqueous systems.},

@article{schragAuthigenicCarbonateHistory2013,
	abstract = {We present a framework for interpreting the carbon isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks, which in turn requires a fundamental reinterpretation of the carbon cycle and redox budgets over Earth's history. We propose that authigenic carbonate, produced in sediment pore fluids during early diagenesis, has played a major role in the carbon cycle in the past. This sink constitutes a minor component of the carbon isotope mass balance under the modern, high levels of atmospheric oxygen but was much larger in times of low atmospheric O2 or widespread marine anoxia. Waxing and waning of a global authigenic carbonate sink helps to explain extreme carbon isotope variations in the Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Triassic.

@article{turchynControlsPrecipitationCarbonate2021,
	abstract = {The vast majority of carbonate minerals in modern marine sediments are biogenic, derived from the skeletal remains of organisms living in the ocean. However, carbonate minerals can also precipitate abiotically within marine sediments, and this carbonate mineral precipitation within sediments has been suggested as a third major, and isotopically distinct, sink in the global carbon cycle, particularly important earlier in Earth history . Here we present a global compilation of pore fluid data and compare the sulfate, calcium, phosphate and magnesium concentrations with pore fluid alkalinity to explore the emerging relationships and explore what drives carbonate mineral precipitation in sediments. Our data compilation shows that the gradient of pore fluid sulfate concentrations correlates strongly with the gradient of alkalinity as well as with the gradient of calcium, and that these correlations improve dramatically in sediments where methane is present. We also note that sedimentary pore fluids that are high in phosphate concentration are also high in alkalinity, which may indicate suppression of carbonate mineral precipitation in the presence of sedimentary phosphate. Our data can be used to highlight sediments where both dolomite formation and dolomitization of previously deposited calcium carbonate minerals is occurring. We explore how carbonate mineral saturation state changes as a function of calcium concentrations, alkalinity, and pH, and suggest a reason why calcium concentrations are never fully depleted in sedimentary pore fluids. We conclude that carbonate minerals precipitate in sediments with methane, where the anaerobic oxidation of this methane helps promote particularly high saturation states for carbonate minerals.},

@article{kastNitrogenIsotopeEvidence2019,
	abstract = {Circulation more than temperature
Changes in continental configuration and sea level affected the ocean's oxygen levels and the rate of denitrification between 70 and 30 million years ago. That finding by Kast et al. shows a fundamental difference from the modern ocean, in which the extent of suboxia is controlled primarily by global temperature. Changes in the nitrogen isotopic composition of marine organic matter correlate with the collision of India and Asia and the circulation changes that occurred as a result. Later, isotopic composition changed further in response to a fall in sea level as global cooling caused ice sheets to grow.
Science, this issue p. 386
The million-year variability of the marine nitrogen cycle is poorly understood. Before 57 million years (Ma) ago, the 15N/14N ratio (δ15N) of foraminifera shell-bound organic matter from three sediment cores was high, indicating expanded water column suboxia and denitrification. Between 57 and 50 Ma ago, δ15N declined by 13 to 16 per mil in the North Pacific and by 3 to 8 per mil in the Atlantic. The decline preceded global cooling and appears to have coincided with the early stages of the Asia-India collision. Warm, salty intermediate-depth water forming along the Tethys Sea margins may have caused the expanded suboxia, ending with the collision. From 50 to 35 Ma ago, δ15N was lower than modern values, suggesting widespread sedimentary denitrification on broad continental shelves. δ15N rose at 35 Ma ago, as ice sheets grew, sea level fell, and continental shelves narrowed.
The ocean was more suboxic and supported greater denitrification in the Paleocene than during the Oligocene.

@article{martinez-garciaIronFertilizationSubantarctic2014,
	abstract = {Productive Dustiness
The idea that biological productivity in the surface ocean is limited by a lack of available iron has been widely accepted, but it has been difficult to show that this effect might have operated in the geological past. Mart{\'\i}nez-Garc{\'\i}a et al. (p. 1347) investigated the isotopic composition of foraminifera-bound nitrogen in samples from an Ocean Drilling Project sediment core and found millennial-scale changes in nitrate consumption correlated with fluxes in the iron burial and productivity proxies over the past 160,000 years. Hence, in the Southern Ocean the biological pump was strengthened when dust fluxes were high, which explains a significant part of the difference in atmospheric CO2 concentrations observed to occur across glacial cycles.
John H. Martin, who discovered widespread iron limitation of ocean productivity, proposed that dust-borne iron fertilization of Southern Ocean phytoplankton caused the ice age reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). In a sediment core from the Subantarctic Atlantic, we measured foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes to reconstruct ice age nitrate consumption, burial fluxes of iron, and proxies for productivity. Peak glacial times and millennial cold events are characterized by increases in dust flux, productivity, and the degree of nitrate consumption; this combination is uniquely consistent with Subantarctic iron fertilization. The associated strengthening of the Southern Ocean's biological pump can explain the lowering of CO2 at the transition from mid-climate states to full ice age conditions as well as the millennial-scale CO2 oscillations.
Nitrogen isotopes in foraminifera show the role of iron fertilization on atmospheric carbon dioxide during the last ice age.

	abstract = {In this study, stable isotope measurements of nitrate (δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3) and suspended particulate nitrogen (δ15NSPN, {\textgreater}51μm) were made on the 2013 US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (GP16). This cruise extended from the nutrient-rich coastal waters of the Peru upwelling system to the oligotrophic waters of the south Pacific subtropical gyre, where low surface nitrate (NO3−) concentrations ({\textless}4μM) and high δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 values (up to 28‰ and 25‰, respectively) were generated from consumption of NO3− by phytoplankton. Analysis of δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 patterns in surface waters relative to δ15NSPN provided insight into supply of nutrients to surface waters along the transect and remineralization at depth. In the subsurface oxygen deficient zone (ODZ), dissimilatory NO3− reduction to nitrite (NO2−) generated distinct elevations in δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 (up to {\textasciitilde}37‰ and 31‰, respectively). Below the oxygen deficient zone, δ15NNO3 values (6 to 10‰) in the intermediate waters (σ0=27.0 to 27.5kgm−3; 500m to 1500m) were elevated relative to deep waters across the entire length of GP16, while intermediate δ18ONO3 values (2 to 3‰) were more similar to deep water values. These observations suggested that both NO3− regeneration and the transport of NO3− from the ODZ influence the intermediate waters of the central and eastern south Pacific. In order to explore this further, results from the GP16 water mass analysis and a NO3− isotope mixing model were employed to quantify the importance of those processes in the thermocline and intermediate waters across GP16. The contribution of NO3− from the ODZ contributed up to 10μM across the thermocline, but generally {\textless}5μM in the intermediate waters. In contrast, it was estimated that remineralization contributed 5 to 15μM of NO3− across the thermocline and intermediate waters. Overall, these results from GP16 confirm that NO3− reduction in the ODZ and organic matter remineralization play important roles in maintaining the widespread elevation in δ15NNO3 observed across the thermocline and intermediate waters of the eastern South Pacific.},

@article{marconiTropicalDominanceN22017,
	abstract = {To investigate the controls on N2 fixation and the role of the Atlantic in the global ocean's fixed nitrogen (N) budget, Atlantic N2 fixation is calculated by combining meridional nitrate fluxes across World Ocean Circulation Experiment sections with observed nitrate 15N/14N differences between northward and southward transported nitrate. N2 fixation inputs of 27.1 $\pm$ 4.3 Tg N/yr and 3.0 $\pm$ 0.5 Tg N/yr are estimated north of 11$\,^{\circ}$S and 24$\,^{\circ}$N, respectively. That is, 90\% of the N2 fixation in the Atlantic north of 11$\,^{\circ}$S occurs south of 24$\,^{\circ}$N in a region with upwelling that imports phosphorus (P) in excess of N relative to phytoplankton requirements. This suggests that, under the modern iron-rich conditions of the equatorial and North Atlantic, N2 fixation occurs predominantly in response to P-bearing, N-poor conditions. We estimate a N2 fixation rate of 30.5 $\pm$ 4.9 Tg N/yr north of 30$\,^{\circ}$S, implying only 3 Tg N/yr between 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 11$\,^{\circ}$S, despite evidence of P-bearing, N-poor surface waters in this region as well; this is consistent with iron limitation of N2 fixation in the South Atlantic. Since the ocean flows through the Atlantic surface in {\textless}2,500 years, similar to the residence time of oceanic fixed N, Atlantic N2 fixation can stabilize the N-to-P ratio of the global ocean. However, the calculated rate of Atlantic N2 fixation is a small fraction of global ocean estimates for either N2 fixation or fixed N loss. This suggests that, in the modern ocean, an approximate balance between N loss and N2 fixation is achieved within the combined Indian and Pacific basins.},

@article{fripiatIsotopeEffectNitrate2019,
	abstract = {Both the nitrogen (N) isotopic composition (δ15N) of the nitrate source and the magnitude of isotope discrimination associated with nitrate assimilation are required to estimate the degree of past nitrate consumption from the δ15N of organic matter in Southern Ocean sediments (e.g., preserved within diatom microfossils). It has been suggested that the amplitude of isotope discrimination (i.e. the isotope effect) correlates with mixed layer depth, driven by a physiological responseof phytoplanktonto light availability, which introduces complexity to the interpretation of sedimentary records. However, most of the isotope effect estimates that underpin this hypothesis derive from acid-preserved water samples,from which nitrite would have been volatilized and lost during storage. Nitrite δ15N in Antarctic Zone surface watersisextremely low (−61 $\pm$ 20‰), consistent with the expression of an equilibrium isotope effect associated with nitrate--nitrite interconversion. Its loss from the combined nitrate + nitrite pool would act to raise the δ15N of nitrate, potentially yielding overestimation of the isotope effect. Here, we revisit the nitrate assimilation isotope effect in the Antarctic Zone with measurements of the δ15N and concentration of nitrate with and without nitrite, using frozen sea water samples from 5 different cruises that collectively cover all sectors of the Southern Ocean. The N isotope effect estimated using nitrate + nitrite δ15N is relatively constant (5.5 $\pm$ 0.6‰) across the Antarctic Zone, shows no relationship with mixed layer depth, and is in agreement with sediment trap δ15N measurements. Estimates of the N isotope effect derived from nitrate-only δ15N are higher and more variable (7.9 $\pm$ 1.5‰), consistent with an artifact from nitrate-nitrite isotope exchange. In the case of the Southern Ocean, we conclude that the δ15N of nitrate + nitrite better reflects the isotope effect of nitrate assimilation. The stability of this isotope effect across the Antarctic Zone simplifies the effort to reconstruct the past degree of nitrate consumption.},

@article{headlyMethodMeasureKr2007,
	abstract = {We describe a new method for precise measurement of Kr/N2 ratios in air bubbles trapped in ice cores and the first reconstruction of atmospheric Kr/N2 during the last glacial maximum (LGM) ∼20,000 years ago. After gravitational correction, the Kr/N2 record in ice cores should represent the atmospheric ratio, which in turn should reflect past ocean temperature change due to the dependence of gas solubility on temperature. The increase in krypton inventory in the glacial ocean due to higher gas solubility in colder water causes a decrease in the atmospheric inventory of krypton. Assuming Kr and N2 inventories in the ocean-atmosphere system are conserved, we use a mass balance model to estimate a mean ocean temperature change between the LGM and today. We measured Kr/N2 in air bubbles in Greenland (GISP2) ice from the late Holocene and LGM, using the present atmosphere as a standard. The late Holocene δKr/N2 means from two sets of measurements are not different from zero (+0.07 $\pm$ 0.30‰ and −0.14 $\pm$ 0.93‰), as expected from the relatively constant climate of the last millennium. The mean δKr/N2 in air bubbles from the LGM is −1.34 $\pm$ 0.37‰. Using the mass balance model, we estimate that the mean temperature change between the LGM ocean and today's ocean was 2.7 $\pm$ 0.6$\,^{\circ}$C. Although this error is large compared to the observed change, this finding is consistent with most previous estimates of LGM deep ocean temperature based on foraminiferal δ18O and sediment pore water δ18O and chlorinity.},

	abstract = {A record of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios from 1006 A.D. to 1978 A.D. has been produced by analysing the air enclosed in three ice cores from Law Dome, Antarctica. The enclosed air has unparalleled age resolution and extends into recent decades, because of the high rate of snow accumulation at the ice core sites. The CO2 data overlap with the record from direct atmospheric measurements for up to 20 years. The effects of diffusion in the firn on the CO2 mixing ratio and age of the ice core air were determined by analyzing air sampled from the surface down to the bubble close-off depth. The uncertainty of the ice core CO2 mixing ratios is 1.2 ppm (1 σ). Preindustrial CO2 mixing ratios were in the range 275--284 ppm, with the lower levels during 1550--1800 A.D., probably as a result of colder global climate. Natural CO2 variations of this magnitude make it inappropriate to refer to a single preindustrial CO2 level. Major CO2 growth occurred over the industrial period except during 1935--1945 A.D. when CO2 mixing ratios stabilized or decreased slightly, probably as a result of natural variations of the carbon cycle on a decadal timescale.},

Its atmospheric budget (sources and sinks), however, has large uncertainties. Inverse modelling, using atmospheric {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} trends, spatial gradients and isotopic source signatures, has recently improved the major source estimates and their spatial--temporal variation. Nevertheless, isotopic data lack {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} source representativeness for many sources, and their isotopic signatures are affected by incomplete knowledge of the spatial distribution of some sources, especially those related to fossil (radiocarbon-free) and microbial gas. This gap is particularly wide for geological {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (geo-{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) seepage, i.e. the natural degassing of hydrocarbons from the Earth's crust.

An inventory of point sources and area sources was developed for each category, defining areal distribution (activity), {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} fluxes (emission factors) and its stable C isotope composition ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{13}}$C{\textless}/span{\textgreater}-{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). These parameters were determined considering geological factors that control methane origin and seepage (e.g. petroleum fields, sedimentary basins, high heat flow regions, faults, seismicity). The global geo-source map reveals that the regions with the highest {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions are all located in the Northern Hemisphere, in North America, in the Caspian region, in Europe and in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf.

@article{burkeStratosphericEruptionsTropical2019,
	abstract = {The record of volcanic forcing of climate over the past 2500 years is based primarily on sulfate concentrations in ice cores. Of particular interest are large volcanic eruptions with plumes that reached high altitudes in the stratosphere, as these afford sulfate aerosols the longest residence time in the atmosphere, and thus have the greatest impact on radiative forcing. Sulfur isotopes measured in ice cores can be used to identify these large eruptions because stratospheric sulfur is exposed to UV radiation, which imparts a time-evolving mass independent fractionation (MIF) that is preserved in the ice. However, sample size requirements of traditional measurement techniques mean that the MIF signal may be obscured, leading to an inconclusive result. Here we present a new method of measuring sulfur isotopes in ice cores by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which reduces sample size requirements by three orders of magnitude. Our method allows us to measure samples containing as little as 10 nmol of sulfur, with a precision of 0.11‰ for δ34S and 0.10‰ for Δ33S, enabling a high-temporal resolution over ice core sulfate peaks. We tested this method on known tropical (Tambora 1815 and Samalas 1257) and extra-tropical (Katmai/Novarupta 1912) stratospheric eruptions from the Tunu2013 ice core in Greenland and the B40 ice core from Antarctica. These high-resolution sulfur isotope records suggest a distinct difference between the signatures of tropical versus extra-tropical eruptions. Furthermore, isotope mass balance on sulfate from extra-tropical eruptions provides a means to estimate the fraction of sulfate deposited that was derived from the stratosphere. This technique applied to unidentified eruptions in ice cores may thus improve the record of explosive volcanism and its forcing of climate.},

Here, we review current knowledge, and introduce a novel framework to help characterize earthquake-triggering processes. This framework outlines three parameters observable at volcanoes, namely magma viscosity, open- or closed-system degassing and the presence or absence of an active hydrothermal system. Our classification illustrates that most types of volcanoes may be seismically-triggered, though require different combinations of volcanic and seismic conditions, and triggering is unlikely unless the system is primed for eruption. Seismically-triggered unrest is more common, and particularly associated with hydrothermal systems.},

Particular attention is given to reconciling the observed spatial distribution of ground motions in terms of physical phenomena related to source, path and site effects. The large number of near-source observed strong ground motions show clear evidence of: forward-directivity, basin generated surface waves, liquefaction and other significant nonlinear site response. The pseudo-acceleration response spectra (SA) amplitudes and significant duration of strong motions agree well with empirical prediction models, except at long vibration periods where the influence of basin-generated surface waves and nonlinear site response are significant and not adequately accounted for in empirical SA models. Pseudo-acceleration response spectra are also compared with those observed in the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and routine design response spectra used in order to emphasise the amplitude of ground shaking and elucidate the importance of local geotechnical characteristics on surface ground motions. The characteristics of the observed vertical component accelerations are shown to be strongly dependent on source-to-site distance and are comparable with those from the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, implying the large amplitudes observed are simply a result of many observations at close distances rather than a peculiar source effect.},

The increased seismic disaster risk in Oklahoma has captured public attention and necessitated actions by decision makers to mediate the consequences. Geospatial modeling to identify the populations exposed to higher levels of potential risk can help prioritize locations for mitigation actions based on the underlying social vulnerability of residents. In this paper, we explore a method for integrating the spatial distribution of seismic risk (hazard exposure) with social vulnerability (hazard impact). Loss scenarios, social vulnerability metrics, and potential physical damage are combined in a geographic information system to identify the spatial vulnerability of an exposed population to the increased seismic risk, and the locations for targeting mitigation actions --- areas with the greatest exposure and vulnerability. The results of induced seismicity earthquake scenarios show disproportionately higher losses for places with more minority populations (primarily African-American) and more renters when compared to the non-induced scenarios, suggesting a potential environmental justice concern.},

	abstract = {The Seafloor Observation Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis along the Japan Trench (S-net) is presently the world's largest network of ocean bottom pressure sensors for real-time tsunami monitoring. This paper analyzes the efficacy of such a vast system in tsunami forecasting through exhaustive synthetic experiments. We consider 1500 hypothetical tsunami scenarios from megathrust earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from Mw 7.7--9.1. We employ a stochastic slip model to emulate heterogeneous slip patterns on specified 240 subfaults over the plate interface of the Japan Trench subduction zone and its vicinity. Subsequently, the associated tsunamis in terms of maximum coastal tsunami heights are evaluated along the 50-m isobath by means of a Green's function summation. To produce tsunami forecasts, we utilize a tsunami inversion from virtually observed waveforms at the S-net stations. Remarkably, forecasts accuracy of approximately 99\% can be achieved using tsunami data within an interval of 3 to 5 min after the earthquake (2-min length), owing to the exceedingly dense observation points. Additionally, we apply an optimization technique to determine the optimal combination of stations with respect to earthquake magnitudes. The results show that the minimum requisite number of stations to maintain the accuracy attained by the existing network configuration decreases from 130 to 90 when the earthquake size increases from Mw 7.7 to 9.1.},

@article{kamranzadEarthquakeRiskAssessment2020,
	abstract = {The megacity of Tehran, the capital of Iran, is subjected to a high earthquake risk. Located at the central part of the Alpine--Himalayan seismic belt, Tehran is surrounded by several active faults that show some M7+ historical earthquake records. The high seismic hazard in combination with a dense population distribution and several vulnerability factors mean Tehran is one of the top 20 worldwide megacities at a high earthquake risk. This article aims to prepare an assessment of the present-day earthquake risk in Tehran. First, the earthquake risk components including hazard, exposure, and vulnerability are evaluated based on some accessible GIS-based datasets (e.g., seismicity, geology, active faults, population distribution, land use, urban fabric, buildings' height and occupancy, structure types, and ages, as well as the vicinity to some critical infrastructures). Then, earthquake hazard maps in terms of PGA are prepared using a probabilistic approach as well as a surface rupture width map. Exposure and vulnerability maps are also provided deterministically in terms of population density and hybrid physical vulnerability, respectively. Finally, all these components are combined in a spatial framework and an earthquake risk map is provided for Tehran.},

We show that the remarkable recording of the ground motion produced in the city itself contains some clues which help explain this disaster. We identify three factors whose unfortunate combination led to the strong ground shaking which destroyed the city: 1) The Rayleigh-like speed of the rupture, 2) The high slip velocity, which exceeded 2m/s over a large part of the fault, 3) The strong directivity, which focused the elastic energy released directly toward the city.},

@article{clarkeProbabilisticVolcanicHazard2020,
	abstract = {Aluto volcano, in the Main Ethiopian Rift, is a peralkaline caldera system, which comprises conglomerations of rhyolite (obsidian) lavas and enigmatic pumice cones. Recent work has found that pumice cone eruptions are highly unsteady, and form convective eruption plumes that frequently collapse to generate pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). We develop a methodology and present results for the first probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment (PVHA) for PDCs at a pumice cone volcano. By doing so, we estimate the conditional probability of inundation by PDCs around Aluto volcano (Ethiopia), incorporating the aleatory uncertainty in PDC hazard. We employ a Monte Carlo energy cone modelling approach, which benefits from parameterisation informed by field investigations and volcanic plume modelling. We find that despite the relatively modest eruptions that are likely to occur, the wide distribution of past vent locations (and thus the high uncertainty of where future vents might open), results in a broad area being potentially at risk of inundation by PDCs. However, the aleatory uncertainty in vent opening means that the conditional probabilities are lower (= 0.05) regions of Aluto caldera. The Monte Carlo energy cone modelling approach provides a quantitative, accountable and defendable background and long-term PVHA for PDCs from Aluto. These results could be combined in the future with hazard assessments relating to tephra fall and/or lava to develop a comprehensive volcanic hazard map for the caldera.},

@article{stoneRiskReductionCommunitybased2014,
	abstract = {Since 2000, a network of volunteers known as vig{\'\i}as has been engaged in community-based volcano monitoring, which involves local citizens in the collection of scientific data, around volc{\'a}n Tungurahua, Ecuador. This paper provides the first detailed description and analysis of this well-established initiative, drawing implications for volcanic risk reduction elsewhere. Based on 32 semi-structured interviews and other qualitative data collected in June and July 2013 with institutional actors and with vig{\'\i}as themselves, the paper documents the origins and development of the network, identifies factors that have sustained it, and analyses the ways in which it contributes to disaster risk reduction. Importantly, the case highlights how this community-based network performs multiple functions in reducing volcanic risk. The vig{\'\i}as network functions simultaneously as a source of observational data for scientists; as a communication channel for increasing community awareness, understanding of hazard processes and for enhancing preparedness; and as an early warning system for civil protection. Less tangible benefits with nonetheless material consequences include enhanced social capital -- through the relationships and capabilities that are fostered -- and improved trust between partners. Establishing trust-based relationships between citizens, the vig{\'\i}as, scientists and civil protection authorities is one important factor in the effectiveness and resilience of the network. Other factors discussed in the paper that have contributed to the longevity of the network include the motivations of the vig{\'\i}as, a clear and regular communication protocol, persistent volcanic activity, the efforts of key individuals, and examples of successful risk reduction attributable to the activities of the network. Lessons that can be learned about the potential of community-based monitoring for disaster risk reduction in other contexts are identified, including what the case tells us about the conditions that can affect the effectiveness of such initiatives and their resilience to changing circumstances.},

Seed variables are used to (1) measure expert performance, (2) enable performance-based weighted combination of experts' distributions, and (3) evaluate and hopefully validate the resulting combination or ``decision maker''. This article reviews the classical model for structured expert judgment and the performance measures, reviews applications, comparing performance-based decision makers with ``equal weight'' decision makers, and collects some lessons learned.},

From their results, they concluded that more than 99\% of this highly toxic metal in the global troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere originated from human activities in the mid 1960s---mainly from the use of alkyl-leaded petrol. At least in part because of this evidence, the United States and other countries limited the use of lead additives in petrol from about 1970. Here we report that, as a result of these policy initiatives, lead concentrations in Greenland snow have decreased by a factor of 7.5 over the past twenty years. We also show that over the same time period, cadmium and zinc concentrations have decreased by a factor of 2.5.},

High-resolution deuterium excess data show prevailing stable SIA from the 1880s until the 1950s, a 2?5\% reduction from the mid-1950s to the early-1990s, and a 5\% increase after 1993. Additional support for this reconstruction is derived from ice-core methanesulphonic acid concentrations and whaling records. While SIA has continued to decline around much of the West Antarctic coastline since the 1950s, concurrent with increasing air and ocean temperatures, the underlying trend is masked in the Ross Sea by a switch to positive SIA anomalies since the early-1990s. This increase is associated with a strengthening of southerly winds and the enhanced northward advection of sea ice.},

Accordingly, we define two new North American Land Mammal Ages, the Santarosean and the Saintagustinean, which subdivide Holocene time and complete a biochronologic system that has proven extremely useful in dating terrestrial deposits and in revealing major features of faunal change through the past 66 million years. The new NALMAs highlight human-induced changes to the Earth system, and inform the debate on whether or not defining an Anthropocene epoch is justified, and if so, when it began.},

	abstract = {We present new measurements of δ13C of CO2 extracted from a high-resolution ice core from Law Dome (East Antarctica), together with firn measurements performed at Law Dome and South Pole, covering the last 150 years. Our analysis is motivated by the need to better understand the role and feedback of the carbon (C) cycle in climate change, by advances in measurement methods, and by apparent anomalies when comparing ice core and firn air δ13C records from Law Dome and South Pole. We demonstrate improved consistency between Law Dome ice, South Pole firn, and the Cape Grim (Tasmania) atmospheric δ13C data, providing evidence that our new record reliably extends direct atmospheric measurements back in time. We also show a revised version of early δ13C measurements covering the last 1000 years, with a mean preindustrial level of −6.50‰. Finally, we use a Kalman Filter Double Deconvolution to infer net natural CO2 fluxes between atmosphere, ocean, and land, which cause small δ13C deviations from the predominant anthropogenically induced δ13C decrease. The main features found from the previous δ13C record are confirmed, including the ocean as the dominant cause for the 1940 A.D. CO2 leveling. Our new record provides a solid basis for future investigation of the causes of decadal to centennial variations of the preindustrial atmospheric CO2 concentration. Those causes are of potential significance for predicting future CO2 levels and when attempting atmospheric verification of recent and future global carbon emission mitigation measures through Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Models.},

Ice could play a role in identifying and defining the Anthropocene. The recurrence of northern hemisphere glaciation and the stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet are both potentially vulnerable to human impact on the environment. However, only a very long hiatus in either would be unusual in the context of the Quaternary Period, requiring the definition of a geological boundary. Human influence can clearly be discerned in several ice-core measurements. These include a sharp boundary in radioactivity due to atmospheric nuclear testing; increases, unprecedented at least in the Holocene, in Greenland concentrations of sulphate, nitrate and metals such as lead; the appearance in ice-core air bubbles of previously undetectable compounds such as SF6; and the rise, unprecedented in the last 800 ka, in concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. Some combination of these changes could be used by future generations to clearly identify the onset of a new epoch defined at a particular calendar date. However, it is not yet clear what the character of the fully developed Anthropocene will be, and it might be wise to let future generations decide, with hindsight, when the Anthropocene started, acknowledging only that we are in the transition towards it.},

@article{watersAnthropoceneFunctionallyStratigraphically2016,
	abstract = {Evidence of an Anthropocene epoch
Humans are undoubtedly altering many geological processes on Earth---and have been for some time. But what is the stratigraphic evidence for officially distinguishing this new human-dominated time period, termed the ``Anthropocene,'' from the preceding Holocene epoch? Waters et al. review climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores. Combined with deposits of new materials and radionuclides, as well as human-caused modification of sedimentary processes, the Anthropocene stands alone stratigraphically as a new epoch beginning sometime in the mid--20th century.
Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2622
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDHumans are altering the planet, including long-term global geologic processes, at an increasing rate. Any formal recognition of an Anthropocene epoch in the geological time scale hinges on whether humans have changed the Earth system sufficiently to produce a stratigraphic signature in sediments and ice that is distinct from that of the Holocene epoch. Proposals for marking the start of the Anthropocene include an ``early Anthropocene'' beginning with the spread of agriculture and deforestation; the Columbian Exchange of Old World and New World species; the Industrial Revolution at {\textasciitilde}1800 CE; and the mid-20th century ``Great Acceleration'' of population growth and industrialization.
ADVANCESRecent anthropogenic deposits contain new minerals and rock types, reflecting rapid global dissemination of novel materials including elemental aluminum, concrete, and plastics that form abundant, rapidly evolving ``technofossils.'' Fossil fuel combustion has disseminated black carbon, inorganic ash spheres, and spherical carbonaceous particles worldwide, with a near-synchronous global increase around 1950. Anthropogenic sedimentary fluxes have intensified, including enhanced erosion caused by deforestation and road construction. Widespread sediment retention behind dams has amplified delta subsidence.Geochemical signatures include elevated levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticide residues, as well as increased 207/206Pb ratios from leaded gasoline, starting between {\textasciitilde}1945 and 1950. Soil nitrogen and phosphorus inventories have doubled in the past century because of increased fertilizer use, generating widespread signatures in lake strata and nitrate levels in Greenland ice that are higher than at any time during the previous 100,000 years.Detonation of the Trinity atomic device at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on 16 July 1945 initiated local nuclear fallout from 1945 to 1951, whereas thermonuclear weapons tests generated a clear global signal from 1952 to 1980, the so-called ``bomb spike'' of excess 14C, 239Pu, and other artificial radionuclides that peaks in 1964.Atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations depart from Holocene and even Quaternary patterns starting at {\textasciitilde}1850, and more markedly at {\textasciitilde}1950, with an associated steep fall in δ13C that is captured by tree rings and calcareous fossils. An average global temperature increase of 0.6o to 0.9oC from 1900 to the present, occurring predominantly in the past 50 years, is now rising beyond the Holocene variation of the past 1400 years, accompanied by a modest enrichment of δ18O in Greenland ice starting at {\textasciitilde}1900. Global sea levels increased at 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mm/year from 1993 to 2010 and are now rising above Late Holocene rates. Depending on the trajectory of future anthropogenic forcing, these trends may reach or exceed the envelope of Quaternary interglacial conditions.Biologic changes also have been pronounced. Extinction rates have been far above background rates since 1500 and increased further in the 19th century and later; in addition, species assemblages have been altered worldwide by geologically unprecedented transglobal species invasions and changes associated with farming and fishing, permanently reconfiguring Earth's biological trajectory.
OUTLOOKThese novel stratigraphic signatures support the formalization of the Anthropocene at the epoch level, with a lower boundary (still to be formally identified) suitably placed in the mid-20th century. Formalization is a complex question because, unlike with prior subdivisions of geological time, the potential utility of a formal Anthropocene reaches well beyond the geological community. It also expresses the extent to which humanity is driving rapid and widespread changes to the Earth system that will variously persist and potentially intensify into the future. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6269/aad2622/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Indicators of the Anthropocene in recent lake sediments differ markedly from Holocene signatures.These include unprecedented combinations of plastics, fly ash, radionuclides, metals, pesticides, reactive nitrogen, and consequences of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. In this sediment core from west Greenland (69˚03'N, 49˚54'W), glacier retreat due to climate warming has resulted in an abrupt stratigraphic transition from proglacial sediments to nonglacial organic matter, effectively demarcating the onset of the Anthropocene.

Human activity is leaving a pervasive and persistent signature on Earth. Vigorous debate continues about whether this warrants recognition as a new geologic time unit known as the Anthropocene. We review anthropogenic markers of functional changes in the Earth system through the stratigraphic record. The appearance of manufactured materials in sediments, including aluminum, plastics, and concrete, coincides with global spikes in fallout radionuclides and particulates from fossil fuel combustion. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles have been substantially modified over the past century. Rates of sea-level rise and the extent of human perturbation of the climate system exceed Late Holocene changes. Biotic changes include species invasions worldwide and accelerating rates of extinction. These combined signals render the Anthropocene stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene and earlier epochs.},

@article{nicewongerPreindustrialAtmosphericEthane2016,
	abstract = {Ethane levels were measured in air extracted from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores ranging in age from 994 to 1918 Common Era (C.E.) There is good temporal overlap between the two data sets from 1600 to 1750 C.E. with ethane levels stable at 397 $\pm$ 28 parts per trillion (ppt) ($\pm$2 standard error (s.e.)) over Greenland and 103 $\pm$ 9 ppt over Antarctica. The observed north/south interpolar ratio of ethane (3.9 $\pm$ 0.1, 1σ) implies considerably more ethane emissions in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, suggesting geologic ethane sources contribute significantly to the preindustrial ethane budget. Box model simulations based on these data constrain the global geologic emissions of ethane to 2.2--3.5 Tg yr−1 and biomass burning emissions to 1.2--2.5 Tg yr−1 during the preindustrial era. The results suggest biomass burning emissions likely increased since the preindustrial period. Biomass burning and geologic outgassing are also sources of atmospheric methane. The results place constraints on preindustrial methane emissions from these sources.},

@article{hmielPreindustrial14CH4Indicates2020,
	abstract = {Atmospheric methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, and its mole fraction has more than doubled since the preindustrial era1. Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate2,3. Carbon-14 in CH4 (14CH4) can be used to distinguish between fossil (14C-free) CH4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct 14CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century4,5. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH4 per year)2,3 between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH4 per year6,7. Geological emissions were less than 15.4 teragrams CH4 per year at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,600 years ago8, but that period is an imperfect analogue for present-day emissions owing to the large terrestrial ice sheet cover, lower sea level and extensive permafrost. Here we use preindustrial-era ice core 14CH4 measurements to show that natural geological CH4 emissions to the atmosphere were about 1.6 teragrams CH4 per year, with a maximum of 5.4 teragrams CH4 per year (95 per cent confidence limit)-an order of magnitude lower than the currently used estimates. This result indicates that anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions are underestimated by about 38 to 58 teragrams CH4 per year, or about 25 to 40 per cent of recent estimates. Our record highlights the human impact on the atmosphere and climate, provides a firm target for inventories of the global CH4 budget, and will help to inform strategies for targeted emission reductions9,10.},

	abstract = {High-resolution oxygen and hydrogen isotope measurements were made on pore fluids from deep-sea sediments from sites in the North and South Atlantic. The data provide direct measurements of changes in the isotopic composition of bottom waters during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 981 in the North Atlantic, currently bathed in North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) reproduces previous results from the Ceara and Bermuda Rises, constraining the glacial--interglacial change in d18O of the deep Atlantic to be 0.7--0.8\%. Results from Site 984, which is located north of Site 981 and at a shallower water depth, yield a similar value (0.8\%), providing insight into the properties of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW). Sites from ODP Leg 177 in the South Atlantic span the modern boundary between northern and southern sources of deep water. Data from the northern site (1088) yield a similar result to sites in the tropical and North Atlantic (0.7\%). At the southern site (1093), located south of the polar front, the change is substantially larger (1.1\%), representing the change in d18O of southern source waters since the LGM. These results confirm previous estimates that the global average change in d18O of seawater is 1.070.1\%. Hydrogen isotopes measured on pore fluids from three sites are consistent with the oxygen isotopes from these locations, giving further support to these results. At all sites studied, the temperature of the deep ocean during the LGM, calculated by combining the pore fluid results with oxygen isotope data from benthic foraminifera, was within 11C of the freezing point of seawater. r 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{weltjeCalibrationXRFCore2008,
	abstract = {On-line analysis of split sediment cores by XRF core scanners has become increasingly popular in the past decade, because it allows nondestructive extraction of near-continuous records of element intensities from sediment cores with a minimum of analytical effort. A disadvantage of XRF core scanning relative to conventional geochemical analysis is the problematic conversion of core-scanner output to element concentrations. The main reason for this long-standing problem is the poorly constrained measurement geometry, attributable to inhomogeneity of the specimens (e.g. variable water content and grain-size distribution), irregularities of the split core surface, and in some setups, spatial variations in thickness of an adhesive pore-water film which forms directly below a protective foil covering the core surface. We propose a log-ratio calibration model for XRF core scanners, derived from a combination of XRF-spectrometry theory, principles of compositional data analysis, and empirical evidence. The log-ratio calibration model provides accurate and precise predictions of sediment composition (element concentrations) from XRF core-scanner output with a limited number of parameters, namely 2(D−1), where D equals the number of chemical elements whose concentrations are to be estimated. The model can accommodate the inherent non-linearity of the relation between (relative) intensities and concentrations, which is apparent from the fact that it provides unbiased estimates. An immediate corollary of our results is that log-ratios of element intensities, which are related to log-ratios of element abundances by a simple linear transformation, provide the most easily interpretable signals of relative changes in chemical composition. Consistent use of log-ratios of element intensities or concentrations should minimise the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions from geochemical proxies. The relative standard deviation (precision) of predicted element concentrations in core GeoB7920 is less than 2\%. Stochastic simulations indicate that this level of precision can be attained with 40 randomly selected calibration specimens. Improved control over input errors and development of robust goodness-of-fit statistics allows XRF core scanning to be developed into a rigorous quantitative measurement technology. The log-ratio calibration equation derived in this study may be adapted to inter-laboratory and inter-instrument calibration as well.},

	abstract = {The Last Interglacial (129--116 thousand years ago (ka)) represents one of the warmest climate intervals of the past 800,000 years and the most recent time when sea level was metres higher than today. However, the timing and magnitude of the peak warmth varies between reconstructions, and the relative importance of individual sources that contribute to the elevated sea level (mass gain versus seawater expansion) during the Last Interglacial remains uncertain. Here we present the first mean ocean temperature record for this interval from noble gas measurements in ice cores and constrain the thermal expansion contribution to sea level. Mean ocean temperature reached its maximum value of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.3 $\,^{\circ}$C warmer-than-modern values at the end of the penultimate deglaciation at 129 ka, which resulted in 0.7 $\pm$ 0.3 m of thermosteric sea-level rise relative to present level. However, this maximum in ocean heat content was a transient feature; mean ocean temperature decreased in the first several thousand years of the interglacial and achieved a stable, comparable-to-modern value by {\textasciitilde}127 ka. The synchroneity of the peak in mean ocean temperature with proxy records of abrupt transitions in the oceanic and atmospheric circulation suggests that the mean ocean temperature maximum is related to the accumulation of heat in the ocean interior during the preceding period of reduced overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the ocean temperature's long-term response to climate perturbations owing to limited observations and a lack of robust reconstructions. Although most of the anthropogenic heat added to the climate system has been taken up by the ocean up until now, its role in a century and beyond is uncertain. Here, using noble gases trapped in ice cores, we show that the mean global ocean temperature increased by 2.57 $\pm$ 0.24 degrees Celsius over the last glacial transition (20,000 to 10,000 years ago). Our reconstruction provides unprecedented precision and temporal resolution for the integrated global ocean, in contrast to the depth-, region-, organism- and season-specific estimates provided by other methods. We find that the mean global ocean temperature is closely correlated with Antarctic temperature and has no lead or lag with atmospheric CO2, thereby confirming the important role of Southern Hemisphere climate in global climate trends. We also reveal an enigmatic 700-year warming during the early Younger Dryas period (about 12,000 years ago) that surpasses estimates of modern ocean heat uptake.},

@article{pollardModellingWestAntarctic2009,
	abstract = {Changes in Earth's orbit are known to influence climate shifts from cold glacials to warm interglacials. How the vast West Antarctic ice sheet responds to these fluctuations is uncertain but, because its collapse could raise sea levels by about 5 metres, of great interest. Naish et al. have analysed the AND-1B ocean sediment core, extracted from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf as part of the ANDRILL drilling project, and find evidence that the ice sheet collapsed periodically during the early Pliocene (3-5 million years ago), when atmospheric CO2 levels were similar to, or slightly higher than today's. The pattern of collapse suggests an influence of approximately 40,000-year cycles in the tilt of Earth's rotational axis (obliquity). Also in this issue of Nature, in a numerical modelling study focused on the past 5 million years in Antarctica, David Pollard and Robert DeConto combine ice sheet (land-supported) and ice shelf (water-supported) modelling approaches to simulate the movement of the grounding line --- the border between land and sea ice. Their results show that over the past 5 million years, the West Antarctic ice sheet transitioned between full, intermediate, and collapsed states in just a few thousand years. This means that the ice sheet is likely to disintegrate if ocean temperatures in the area rise by 5 C.},

@article{pollardEstimatingModernElevations2018,
	abstract = {A coupled ice sheet-Earth-sea level model is used to estimate the modern elevations of shoreline features that were formed at high sea level stands during the warm mid Pliocene 3 million years ago. Knowledge of global mean sea level during this period is important as an indicator of possible future ice sheet retreat and sea level rise. However, local shoreline elevations can deviate from the eustatic mean by various geologic processes over the last 3 million years, including glacial isostatic adjustment of the solid Earth and gravitational field due to both Pliocene ice-cover changes and more recent glacial cycles. Our coupled model includes glacial isostatic adjustment processes and simulates Antarctic ice sheet, global sea level, and solid Earth variations in the warmest mid-Pliocene and over the last 40,000 years. Global maps of estimated modern elevations of Pliocene shoreline markers are produced for a standard radial profile of Earth viscosity and lithospheric thickness. Results are compared to an earlier study with an uncoupled Earth-sea level model and a different methodology (Raymo et al., Nature Geoscience, 2011, https://doi.org:/10.1038/ngeo1118). As in that study, Pliocene shoreline elevations diverge significantly from the eustatic value in widespread regions, especially in the vicinity of present and former ice sheets. In some other regions, elevations are close to eustatic. The results emphasize that care should be taken in interpreting elevations of paleo-shoreline markers.},

@article{mcconnellPervasiveArcticLead2019,
	abstract = {Lead pollution in Arctic ice reflects large-scale historical changes in midlatitude industrial activities such as ancient lead/silver production and recent fossil fuel burning. Here we used measurements in a broad array of 13 accurately dated ice cores from Greenland and Severnaya Zemlya to document spatial and temporal changes in Arctic lead pollution from 200 BCE to 2010 CE, with interpretation focused on 500 to 2010 CE. Atmospheric transport modeling indicates that Arctic lead pollution was primarily from European emissions before the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. Temporal variability was surprisingly similar across the large swath of the Arctic represented by the array, with 250- to 300-fold increases in lead pollution observed from the Early Middle Ages to the 1970s industrial peak. Superimposed on these exponential changes were pronounced, multiannual to multidecadal variations, marked by increases coincident with exploitation of new mining regions, improved technologies, and periods of economic prosperity; and decreases coincident with climate disruptions, famines, major wars, and plagues. Results suggest substantial overall growth in lead/silver mining and smelting emissions---and so silver production---from the Early through High Middle Ages, particularly in northern Europe, with lower growth during the Late Middle Ages into the Early Modern Period. Near the end of the second plague pandemic (1348 to ∼1700 CE), lead pollution increased sharply through the Industrial Revolution. North American and European pollution abatement policies have reduced Arctic lead pollution by {\textgreater}80\% since the 1970s, but recent levels remain ∼60-fold higher than at the start of the Middle Ages.},

@article{cauquoinUse10BePredict2014,
	abstract = {The Laschamp excursion is a period of reduced geomagnetic field intensity occurring 40.7 $\pm$ 1.0 kyr ago. As a consequence, cosmogenic isotope production increased dramatically and its sensitivity to solar activity was enhanced during this period. The latter occurs because a larger fraction of the lower-energy interstellar galactic cosmic-ray particles, normally excluded by the geomagnetic field, is able to reach Earth's atmosphere. This produces a cosmogenic isotope production signal with a significant structure. As high-resolution 10Be profiles from both Antarctica (EDC) and Greenland (NGRIP-GRIP) during this crucial period are now available, one can use them as input into a box carbon cycle model in order to predict atmospheric 14C variations due to the Laschamp excursion. For this purpose, 10Be data are converted into 14C, using production calculations for the 10Be-14C conversion, after correction for the estimated difference of sensitivity between polar and global 10Be deposition. Several scenarios of carbon cycle state are simulated, from preindustrial to glacial conditions. Applying two recent cosmogenic isotope production calculations for the 10Be to 14C conversion, we found that the resulting atmospheric Δ14C variations are very sensitive to which of these two are employed. For example, Δ14C amplitude under glacial conditions varies from 260‰ (EDC) and 320‰ (Greenland) to 430‰ (EDC) and 510‰ (Greenland) depending on the formulation used for 10Be-14C conversion.},

The Yangkou record shows a relatively gradual transition into the D/O 14 and 16 events. The discrepancy between the abrupt and gradual transitions of D/O 14 in the records from northern and southern China, respectively, suggests different responses of the ASM to climate changes in the high northern latitudes. The higher resolution δ18O record and more precise 230Th dating indicate that the timing of D/O 14 and 17 in the Hulu records at 53 and 58 ka should be shifted to 54.3 and 59 ka, respectively. The gradual strengthening of the ASM at the onsets of D/O 16 and 14 in our record is different from the abrupt temperature rise in the northern high latitudes. Some other factors must contribute to this relatively gradual ASM change in southern China, but the actual reason is still unknown.},

	abstract = {All together then
Many geographically dispersed records from across the globe reveal the occurrence of abrupt climate changes, called interstadial events, during the last glacial period. These events appear to have happened at the same time, but the difficulty of determining absolute dates in many of the records have made that proposition difficult to prove. Corrick et al. present results from 63 precisely dated speleothems that confirm the synchrony of those interstadial events. Their results also provide a tool with which to validate model simulations of abrupt climate change and calibrate other time series such as ice-core chronologies.
Science, this issue p. 963
Abrupt climate changes during the last glacial period have been detected in a global array of palaeoclimate records, but our understanding of their absolute timing and regional synchrony is incomplete. Our compilation of 63 published, independently dated speleothem records shows that abrupt warmings in Greenland were associated with synchronous climate changes across the Asian Monsoon, South American Monsoon, and European-Mediterranean regions that occurred within decades. Together with the demonstration of bipolar synchrony in atmospheric response, this provides independent evidence of synchronous high-latitude--to-tropical coupling of climate changes during these abrupt warmings. Our results provide a globally coherent framework with which to validate model simulations of abrupt climate change and to constrain ice-core chronologies.
Rapid climate changes occurred synchronously throughout middle and high latitudes during the last glacial period.

@article{turneyObliquitydrivenExpansionNorth2015,
	abstract = {North Atlantic late Pleistocene climate (60,000 to 11,650 years ago) was characterized by abrupt and extreme millennial duration oscillations known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events. However, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 23,000 to 19,000 cal years ago (23 to 19 ka), no D-O events are observed in the Greenland ice cores. Our new analysis of the Greenland δ18O record reveals a switch in the stability of the climate system around 30 ka, suggesting that a critical threshold was passed. Climate system modeling suggests that low axial obliquity at this time caused vastly expanded sea ice in the Labrador Sea, shifting Northern Hemisphere westerly winds south and reducing the strength of meridional overturning circulation. The results suggest that these feedbacks tipped the climate system into full glacial conditions, leading to maximum continental ice growth during the LGM.},

	abstract = {An expanded Cariaco Basin 14C chronology is tied to 230Th-dated Hulu Cave speleothem records in order to provide detailed marine-based 14C calibration for the past 50,000 years. The revised, high-resolution Cariaco 14C calibration record agrees well with data from 230Th-dated fossil corals back to 33ka, with continued agreement despite increased scatter back to 50ka, suggesting that the record provides accurate calibration back to the limits of radiocarbon dating. The calibration data document highly elevated Δ14C during the Glacial period. Carbon cycle box model simulations show that the majority of observed Δ14C change can be explained by increased 14C production. However, from 45 to 15ka, Δ14C remains anomalously high, indicating that the distribution of radiocarbon between surface and deep ocean reservoirs was different than it is today. Additional observations of the magnitude, spatial extent and timing of deep ocean Δ14C shifts are critical for a complete understanding of observed Glacial Δ14C variability.},

@article{bardRadiocarbonCalibrationComparison2013,
	abstract = {We present a new record of radiocarbon ages measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on a deep-sea core collected off the Pakistan Margin. The 14C ages measured on the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber from core MD04-2876 define a high and stable sedimentation rate on the order of 50 cm/kyr over the last 50 kyr. The site is distant from the main upwelling zone of the western Arabian Sea where 14C reservoir age is large and may be variable. Many independent proxies based on elemental analyses, mineralogy, biomarkers, isotopic proxies, and foraminiferal abundances show abrupt changes correlative with Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. It is now common knowledge that these climatic events also affected the Arabian Sea during the last glacial period through changes in the Indian monsoon and in ventilation at intermediate depths. The stratigraphic agreement between all proxies, from fine- to coarse-size fractions, indicates that the foraminiferal 14C ages are representative of the different sediment fractions.
To build a calendar age scale for core MD04-2876, we matched its climate record to the oxygen isotopic (δ18O) profile of Hulu Cave stalagmites that have been accurately dated by U-Th (Wang et al. 2001; Southon et al. 2012; Edwards et al., submitted). Both archives exhibit very similar signatures, even for century-long events linked to monsoonal variations. For comparison, we have also updated our previous work on core MD95-2042 from the Iberian Margin (Bard et al. 2004a,b,c), whose climate record has likewise been tuned to the high-resolution δ18O Hulu Cave profile. Sophisticated and novel statistical techniques were used to interpolate ages and calculate uncertainties between chronological tie-points (Heaton et al. 2013, this issue). The data from the Pakistan and Iberian margins compare well even if they come from distant sites characterized by different oceanic conditions. Collectively, the data also compare well with the IntCal09 curve, except for specific intervals around 16 cal kyr BP and from 28 to 31 cal kyr BP. During these intervals, the data indicate that 14C is somewhat older than indicated by the IntCal09 curve. Agreement between the data from both oceanic sites suggests that the discrepancy is not due to local changes of sea-surface 14C reservoir ages, but rather that the IntCal09 curve needed to be updated in these intervals as has been done in the framework of IntCal13 (Reimer et al. 2013a, this issue).},

@article{stockerMinimumThermodynamicModel2003,
	abstract = {The simplest possible model is proposed to explain a large fraction of the millennial climate variability measured in the isotopic composition of Antarctic ice cores. The model results from the classic bipolar seesaw by coupling it to a heat reservoir. In this ``thermal bipolar seesaw'' the heat reservoir convolves northern time signals with a characteristic timescale. Applying the model to the data of GRIP and Byrd, we demonstrate that maximum correlation can be obtained using a timescale of about 1000--1500 years. Higher correlations are obtained by first filtering out the long-term variability which is due to astronomical and greenhouse gas forcing and not part of the thermal bipolar seesaw. The model resolves the apparent confusion whether northern and southern climate records are in or out of phase, synchronous, or time lagged.},

Experiments performed with an atmospheric general circulation model including water isotopes support its temperature interpretation. We assessed the general correspondence between Dansgaard-Oeschger events and their smoothed Antarctic counterparts for this Dome C record, which reveals the presence of such features with similar amplitudes during previous glacial periods. We suggest that the interplay between obliquity and precession accounts for the variable intensity of interglacial periods in ice core records.

Profiles of 18O/{\textless}16O ratio along three previous deep Greenland ice cores1--3 seemed to reveal irregular but well-defined episodes of relatively mild climate conditions (interstadials) during the mid and late parts of the last glaciation, but there has been some doubt as to whether the shifts in oxygen isotope ratio were genuine representations of changes in climate, rather than artefacts due to disturbed stratification. Here we present results from a new deep ice core drilled at the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, where the depositional environ-ment and the flow pattern of the ice are close to ideal for core recovery and analysis. The results reproduce the previous findings to such a degree that the existence of the interstadial episodes can no longer be in doubt. According to a preliminary timescale based on stratigraphic studies, the interstadials lasted from 500 to 2,000 years, and their irregular occurrence suggests complexity in the behaviour of the North Atlantic ocean circulation.},

@article{dunleaIntercomparisonXRFCore2020,
	abstract = {X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of marine sediment has the potential to yield near-continuous and high-resolution records of elemental abundances, which are often interpreted as proxies for paleoceanographic processes over different time scales. However, many other variables also affect scanning XRF measurements and convolute the quantitative calibrations of element abundances and comparisons of data from different labs. Extensive interlab comparisons of XRF scanning results and calibrations are essential to resolve ambiguities and to understand the best way to interpret the data produced. For this study, we sent a set of seven marine sediment sections (1.5 m each) to be scanned by seven XRF facilities around the world to compare the outcomes amidst a myriad of factors influencing the results. Results of raw element counts per second (cps) were different between labs, but element ratios were more comparable. Four of the labs also scanned a set of homogenized sediment pellets with compositions determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) to convert the raw XRF element cps to concentrations in two ways: a linear calibration and a log-ratio calibration. Although both calibration curves are well fit, the results show that the log-ratio calibrated data are significantly more comparable between labs than the linearly calibrated data. Smaller-scale (higher-resolution) features are often not reproducible between the different scans and should be interpreted with caution. Along with guidance on practical calibrations, our study recommends best practices to increase the quality of information that can be derived from scanning XRF to benefit the field of paleoceanography.},

Comparison of XRF scanner measurements from the sediment surface and dry powder samples of sediment core GeoB7920 indicates strongly reduced element intensities for the lighter elements Al and Si. We relate the lower element intensities of the measurements taken at the sediment surface to the amount of water in the sample volume analyzed by the XRF core scanner. The heavier elements K, Ca, Ti, and Fe remain relatively unaffected by the variation of any physical property within sediment core GeoB7920. Additionally, we successfully use the elemental intensity of Cl as a proxy for the seawater content in the sample volume analyzed by the XRF core scanner.

@article{liebrandCyclostratigraphyEccentricityTuning2016,
	abstract = {Few astronomically calibrated high-resolution (≤5 kyr) climate records exist that span the Oligocene--Miocene time interval. Notably, available proxy records show responses varying in amplitude at frequencies related to astronomical forcing, and the main pacemakers of global change on astronomical time-scales remain debated. Here we present newly generated X-ray fluorescence core scanning and benthic foraminiferal stable oxygen and carbon isotope records from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1264 (Walvis Ridge, southeastern Atlantic Ocean). Complemented by data from nearby Site 1265, the Site 1264 benthic stable isotope records span a continuous ∼13-Myr interval of the Oligo-Miocene (30.1--17.1 Ma) at high resolution (∼3.0 kyr). Spectral analyses in the stratigraphic depth domain indicate that the largest amplitude variability of all proxy records is associated with periods of ∼3.4 m and ∼0.9 m, which correspond to 405- and ∼110-kyr eccentricity, using a magnetobiostratigraphic age model. Maxima in CaCO3 content, δ18O and δ13C are interpreted to coincide with ∼110 kyr eccentricity minima. The strong expression of these cycles in combination with the weakness of the precession- and obliquity-related signals allow construction of an astronomical age model that is solely based on tuning the CaCO3 content to the nominal (La2011\_ecc3L) eccentricity solution. Very long-period eccentricity maxima (∼2.4-Myr) are marked by recurrent episodes of high-amplitude ∼110-kyr δ18O cycles at Walvis Ridge, indicating greater sensitivity of the climate/cryosphere system to short eccentricity modulation of climatic precession. In contrast, the responses of the global (high-latitude) climate system, cryosphere, and carbon cycle to the 405-kyr cycle, as expressed in benthic δ18O and especially δ13C signals, are more pronounced during ∼2.4-Myr minima. The relationship between the recurrent episodes of high-amplitude ∼110-kyr δ18O cycles and the ∼1.2-Myr amplitude modulation of obliquity is not consistent through the Oligo-Miocene. Identification of these recurrent episodes at Walvis Ridge, and their pacing by the ∼2.4-Myr eccentricity cycle, revises the current understanding of the main climate events of the Oligo-Miocene.},

Whenever ice sheet size surpasses a critical threshold indicated by the benthic oxygen isotope (δ18O) value of 3.5 per mil during each of the past five glaciation cycles, indicators of iceberg discharge and sea-surface temperature display dramatically larger amplitudes of millennial-scale variability than when ice sheets are small. Sea-surface temperature oscillations of 1$\,^{\circ}$ to 2$\,^{\circ}$C increase in size to approximately 4$\,^{\circ}$ to 6$\,^{\circ}$C, and catastrophic iceberg discharges begin alternating repeatedly with brief quiescent intervals. The glacial growth associated with this amplification threshold represents a relatively small departure from the modern ice sheet configuration and sea level.

@article{chapagainWaterFootprintCotton2006,
	abstract = {The consumption of a cotton product is connected to a chain of impacts on the water resources in the countries where cotton is grown and processed. The aim of this paper is to assess the `water footprint' of worldwide cotton consumption, identifying both the location and the character of the impacts. The study distinguishes between three types of impact: evaporation of infiltrated rainwater for cotton growth (green water use), withdrawal of ground- or surface water for irrigation or processing (blue water use) and water pollution during growth or processing. The latter impact is quantified in terms of the dilution volume necessary to assimilate the pollution. For the period 1997--2001 the study shows that the worldwide consumption of cotton products requires 256 Gm3 of water per year, out of which about 42\% is blue water, 39\% green water and 19\% dilution water. Impacts are typically cross-border. About 84\% of the water footprint of cotton consumption in the EU25 region is located outside Europe, with major impacts particularly in India and Uzbekistan. Given the general lack of proper water pricing mechanisms or other ways of transmitting productioninformation, cotton consumers have little incentive to take responsibility for the impacts on remote water systems.},

Mismanagement of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a monthly estimated use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves globally, is resulting in widespread environmental contamination. This poses a risk to public health as waste is a vector for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which survives up to 3 days on plastics, and there are also broad impacts to ecosystems and organisms. Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use of plastics. There is a need to assess alternatives that allow reductions of PPE and reinforce awareness on the proper public use and disposal. Finally, assessment of contamination and impacts of plastics driven by the pandemic will be required once the outbreak ends.},

@article{huybersIntegratedSummerInsolation2008,
	abstract = {Although the origins of the 40,000-year glacial cycles during the early Pleistocene are readily attributed to changes in Earth's obliquity (also having a 40,000-year period), the lack of ice-volume variability at precession periods (20,000 years) is difficult to reconcile with most parameterizations of the insolation forcing. It was recently proposed that precession's influence on glaciation is muted because variations in the intensity of summer insolation are counterbalanced by changes in the duration of the summertime, but no climate model has yet been shown to generate obliquity period glacial cycles in response to the seasonal insolation forcing. Here we present a coupled ice-sheet/energy-balance model that reproduces the seasonal cycle and, when run over long time periods, generates glacial variability in response to changes in Earth's orbital configuration. The model is forced by the full seasonal cycle in insolation, and its response can be understood within the context of the integrated summer insolation forcing. The simple fact that obliquity's period is roughly twice as long as that of precession results in a larger amplitude glacial response to obliquity. However, for the model to generate almost exclusively obliquity period glacial variability, two other conditions must be met. First, the ice sheet's ablation zone must reside poleward of ∼60$\,^{\circ}$N because insolation intensity is more sensitive to changes in Earth's obliquity at high latitudes. Second, the ablation season must be long enough for precession's opposing influences on summer and fall insolation intensity to counterbalance one another. These conditions are consistent with a warm climate and a thin ice sheet, where the latter is simulated as a response to subglacial sediment deformation. If a colder climate is prescribed, or in the absence of basal motion, ice sheets tend to be larger and undergo greater precession period variability, in keeping with proxy observations of late Pleistocene glaciation.},

@article{hajekAutogenicSedimentationClastic2017,
	abstract = {Internally generated, or autogenic, terrestrial and marine sediment-transport dynamics can produce depositional patterns similar to those associated with climatic, tectonic, or sea level changes. A central challenge in accurately interpreting the sedimentary archive is determining what scales and types of deposits reflect autogenic controls on sedimentation in different environments. Autogenic sediment-transport dynamics commonly result from intermittent sediment storage in transient landforms, which produces episodic, spatially discontinuous sedimentation across a basin. The transition from localized, variable sedimentation to even, basin-wide sedimentation marks the shift from stochastic landscape dynamics to deterministic deposition responding to the long-term balance between sediment supply and the creation of space to accommodate sediment. This threshold can be measured in a wide variety of stratigraphic successions and has important bearing on whether climatic, tectonic, or sea level signals can be recognized in physical sedimentary deposits.},

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with large natural sources, reservoirs, and sinks. Dyonisius et al. found that methane emissions from old, cold-region carbon reservoirs like permafrost and methane hydrates were minor during the last deglaciation (see the Perspective by Dean). They analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric methane trapped in bubbles in Antarctic ice and found that methane emissions from those old carbon sources during the warming interval were small. They argue that this finding suggests that methane emissions in response to future warming likely will not be as large as some have suggested.
Science, this issue p. 907; see also p. 846
Permafrost and methane hydrates are large, climate-sensitive old carbon reservoirs that have the potential to emit large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as the Earth continues to warm. We present ice core isotopic measurements of methane (Δ14C, δ13C, and δD) from the last deglaciation, which is a partial analog for modern warming. Our results show that methane emissions from old carbon reservoirs in response to deglacial warming were small ({\textless}19 teragrams of methane per year, 95\% confidence interval) and argue against similar methane emissions in response to future warming. Our results also indicate that methane emissions from biomass burning in the pre-Industrial Holocene were 22 to 56 teragrams of methane per year (95\% confidence interval), which is comparable to today.
Methane emissions from permafrost and gas hydrates were small during the last deglaciation.

The practically unlimited amount of ice available at these sites satisfies a need in the community for studies of trace components requiring large sample volumes. For margin sites to be useful as ancient ice archives, the ice stratigraphy needs to be understood and age models need to be established. We present measurements of trapped gases in ice from Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, to date the ice and assess the completeness of the stratigraphic section. Using \textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O of O$_{\textrm{2}}$ and methane concentrations, we unambiguously identify ice from the last glacial cycle, covering every climate interval from the early Holocene to the penultimate interglacial. A high-resolution transect reveals the last deglaciation and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in detail. We observe large-scale deformation in the form of folding, but individual stratigraphic layers do not appear to have undergone irregular thinning. Rather, it appears that the entire LGM--deglaciation sequence has been transported from the interior of the ice sheet to the surface of Taylor Glacier relatively undisturbed. We present an age model that builds the foundation for gas studies on Taylor Glacier. A comparison with the Taylor Dome ice core confirms that the section we studied on Taylor Glacier is better suited for paleo-climate reconstructions of the LGM due to higher accumulation rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{leeExcessMethaneGreenland2020,
	abstract = {Ice core records of atmospheric methane (CH4) and its isotopic composition provide important information about biogeochemical cycles in the past. Interpreting these data requires that they faithfully record the composition of the atmosphere. In this study, we describe anomalies of up to 30--40 ppb CH4 that are only observed in dust-rich ({\textgreater}\$60 ng Ca/g ice), glacialperiod ice measured with standard melt-refreeze methods. The stable isotopic composition of CH4 is also significantly affected. Results from the GISP2 and NEEM ice cores from Greenland show that excess CH4 is either released or produced in the presence of liquid water in amounts which are highly correlated with the abundance of Ca2þ and mineral dust in the sample. Additional experiments show that excess CH4 is unaffected by the addition of HgCl2 (a microbial inhibitor) and is not related to ice core storage time. Dust concentrations in Antarctic ice cores are an order of magnitude lower than in Greenlandic ice cores and no excess CH4 was observed in samples from the Antarctic WAIS Divide (WD) and South Pole (SPICE) ice cores. While the overall structure of the ice core atmospheric methane history is minimally impacted by excess CH4, the impacts on the isotopic record and on inverse models used to reconstruct CH4 sources are greater. We propose three potential mechanisms to explain the presence of excess CH4: (1) that CH4 is adsorbed on dust particles prior to deposition on the ice sheet and is slowly desorbed during the melt-extraction step of sample analysis; (2) that dust acts as a micro-environment within the ice sheet for methanogenic extremophiles; or (3) that excess CH4 is a product of abiotic degradation of organic compounds during the melt-extraction step of sample analysis.},

@article{postUsingStableIsotopes2002,
	abstract = {The stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

@article{deniroInfluenceDietDistribution1981,
	abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant nitrogen isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the nitrogen in an animal reflects the nitrogen isotopic composition of its diet. The δ15N values of the whole bodies of animals are usually more positive than those of their diets. Different individuals of a species raised on the same diet can have significantly different δ15N values. The variability of the relationship between the δ15N values of animals and their diets is greater for different species raised on the same diet than for the same species raised on different diets. Different tissues of mice are also enriched in 15N relative to the diet, with the difference between the δ15N values of a tissue and the diet depending on both the kind of tissue and the diet involved. The δ15N values ofcollagen and chitin. biochemical components that are often preserved in fossil animal remains, are also related to the δ15N value of the diet. The dependence of the δ15N values of whole animals and their tissues and biochemical components on the δ15N value of diet indicates that the isotopic composition of animal nitrogen can be used to obtain information about an animal's diet if its potential food sources had different δ15N values. The nitrogen isotopic method of dietary analysis probably can be used to estimate the relative use of legumes vs non-legumes or of aquatic vs terrestrial organisms as food sources for extant and fossil animals. However, the method probably will not be applicable in those modern ecosystems in which the use of chemical fertilizers has influenced the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in food sources. The isotopic method of dietary analysis was used to reconstruct changes in the diet of the human population that occupied the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico over a 7000 yr span. Variations in the δ15C and δ15N values of bone collagen suggest that C4 and/or CAM plants (presumably mostly corn) and legumes (presumably mostly beans) were introduced into the diet much earlier than suggested by conventional archaeological analysis.},

	abstract = {The early Paleogene represents the most recent interval in Earth's history characterized by global greenhouse warmth on multi-million year timescales, yet our understanding of long-term climate and carbon cycle evolution in the low latitudes, and in particular the Indian Ocean, remains very poorly constrained. Here we present the first long-term sub-eccentricity-resolution stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) and trace element (Mg/Ca and B/Ca) records spanning the late Paleocene--early Eocene (∼58--53 Ma) across a surface--deep hydrographic reconstruction of the northern Indian Ocean, resolving late Paleocene 405-kyr paced cyclicity and a portion of the PETM recovery. Our new records reveal a long-term warming of ∼4--5$\,^{\circ}$C at all depths in the water column, with absolute surface ocean temperatures and magnitudes of warming comparable to the low latitude Pacific. As a result of warming, we observe a long-term increase in δ18Osw of the mixed layer, implying an increase in net evaporation. We also observe a collapse in the temperature gradient between mixed layer- and thermocline-dwelling species from ∼57--54 Ma, potentially due to either the development of a more homogeneous water column with a thicker mixed layer, or depth migration of the Morozovella in response to warming. Synchronous warming at both low and high latitudes, along with decreasing B/Ca ratios in planktic foraminifera indicating a decrease in ocean pH and/or increasing dissolved inorganic carbon, suggest that global climate was forced by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations during this time.},

@article{cookGlacierAlgaeAccelerate2020,
	abstract = {Abstract. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest single contributor to eustatic sea level and is amplified by the growth of pigmented algae on the ice surface, which increases solar radiation absorption. This biological albedo-reducing effect and its impact upon sea level rise has not previously been quantified. Here, we combine field spectroscopy with a radiative-transfer model, supervised classification of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite remote-sensing data, and runoff modelling to calculate biologically driven ice surface ablation. We demonstrate that algal growth led to an additional 4.4--6.0 Gt of runoff from bare ice in the south-western sector of the GrIS in summer 2017, representing 10 \%--13 \% of the total. In localized patches with high biomass accumulation, algae accelerated melting by up to 26.15$\pm$3.77 \% (standard error, SE). The year 2017 was a high-albedo year, so we also extended our analysis to the particularly low-albedo 2016 melt season. The runoff from the south-western bare-ice zone attributed to algae was much higher in 2016 at 8.8--12.2 Gt, although the proportion of the total runoff contributed by algae was similar at 9 \%--13 \%. Across a 10 000 km2 area around our field site, algae covered similar proportions of the exposed bare ice zone in both years (57.99 \% in 2016 and 58.89 \% in 2017), but more of the algal ice was classed as ``high biomass'' in 2016 (8.35 \%) than 2017 (2.54 \%). This interannual comparison demonstrates a positive feedback where more widespread, higher-biomass algal blooms are expected to form in high-melt years where the winter snowpack retreats further and earlier, providing a larger area for bloom development and also enhancing the provision of nutrients and liquid water liberated from melting ice. Our analysis confirms the importance of this biological albedo feedback and that its omission from predictive models leads to the systematic underestimation of Greenland's future sea level contribution, especially because both the bare-ice zones available for algal colonization and the length of the biological growth season are set to expand in the future.},

	abstract = {We revisited the lessons of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake Tsunami disaster specifically on the response and impact, and discussed the paradigm shift of Japan's tsunami disaster management policies and the perspectives for reconstruction. Revisiting the modern histories of Tohoku tsunami disasters and pre-2011 tsunami countermeasures, we clarified how Japan's coastal communities have prepared for tsunamis. The discussion mainly focuses on structural measures such as seawalls and breakwaters and non-structural measures of hazard map and evacuation. The responses to the 2011 event are discussed specifically on the tsunami warning system and efforts to identify the tsunami impacts. The nation-wide post-tsunami survey results shed light on the mechanisms of structural destruction, tsunami loads and structural vulnerability to inform structural rehabilitation measures and land-use planning. Remarkable paradigm shifts in designing coastal protection and disaster mitigation measures were introduced, leading with a new concept of potential tsunami levels: Prevention (Level 1) and Mitigation (Level 2) levels according to the level of `protection'. The seawall is designed with reference to Level 1 tsunami scenario, while comprehensive disaster management measures should refer to Level 2 tsunami for protection of human lives and reducing potential losses and damage. Throughout the case study in Sendai city, the proposed reconstruction plan was evaluated from the tsunami engineering point of view to discuss how the post 2011 paradigm was implemented in coastal communities for future disaster mitigation. The analysis revealed that Sendai city's multiple protection measures for Level 2 tsunami will contribute to a substantial reduction of the tsunami inundation zone and potential losses, combined with an effective tsunami evacuation plan.},

The fractionation of nitrogen and argon isotopes at the end of the Younger Dryas cold interval, recorded in Greenland ice, demonstrates that warming at this time was abrupt. This warming coincides with the onset of a prominent rise in atmospheric methane concentration, indicating that the climate change was synchronous (within a few decades) over a region of at least hemispheric extent, and providing constraints on previously proposed mechanisms of climate change at this time. The depth of the nitrogen-isotope signal relative to the depth of the climate change recorded in the ice matrix indicates that, during the Younger Dryas, the summit of Greenland was 15 $\pm$ 3 $\,^{\circ}$C colder than today.},

@article{severinghausThermalFractionationAir2001,
	abstract = {Air withdrawn from the top 5?15 m of the polar snowpack (firn) shows anomalous enrichment of heavy gases during summer, including inert gases. Following earlier work, we ascribe this to thermal diffusion, the tendency of a gas mixture to separate in a temperature gradient, with heavier molecules migrating toward colder regions. Summer warmth creates a temperature gradient in the top few meters of the firn due to the thermal inertia of the underlying firn and causes gas fractionation by thermal diffusion. Here we explore and quantify this process further in order to (1) correct for bias caused by thermal diffusion in firn air and ice core air isotope records, (2) help calibrate a new technique for measuring temperature change in ice core gas records based on thermal diffusion [Severinghaus et al., 1998], and (3) address whether air in polar snow convects during winter and, if so, whether it creates a rectification of seasonality that could bias the ice core record. We sampled air at 2-m-depth intervals from the top 15 m of the firn at two Antarctic sites, Siple Dome and South Pole, including a winter sampling at the pole. We analyzed 15N/14N, 40Ar/36Ar, 40Ar/38Ar, 18O/16O of O2, O2/N2, 84Kr/36Ar, and 132Xe/36Ar. The results show the expected pattern of fractionation and match a gas diffusion model based on first principles to within 30\%. Although absolute values of thermal diffusion sensitivities cannot be determined from the data with precision, relative values of different gas pairs may. At Siple Dome, δ40Ar/4 is 66 $\pm$ 2\% as sensitive to thermal diffusion as δ15N, in agreement with laboratory calibration; δ18O/2 is 83 $\pm$ 3\%, and δ84Kr/48 is 33 $\pm$ 3\% as sensitive as δ15N. The corresponding figures for summer South Pole are 64 $\pm$ 2\%, 81 $\pm$ 3\%, and 34 $\pm$ 3\%. Accounting for atmospheric change, the figure for δO2/N2/4 is 90 $\pm$ 3\% at Siple Dome. Winter South Pole shows a strong depletion of heavy gases as expected. However, the data do not fit the model well in the deeper part of the profile and yield a systematic drift with depth in relative thermal diffusion sensitivities (except for Kr, constant at 34 $\pm$ 4\%), suggesting the action of some other process that is not currently understood. No evidence for wintertime convection or a rectifier effect is seen.},

It is likely that in the future, we will experience several disasters per year that kill more than 10 000 people. A calamity with a million casualties is just a matter of time. This situation is mainly a consequence of increased vulnerability. Climate change may also be affecting the frequency of extreme weather events as well as the vulnerability of coastal areas due to sea-level rise. Disastrous outcomes can only increase unless better ways are found to mitigate the effects through improved forecasting and warning, together with more community preparedness and resilience. There are particular difficulties with extreme events, which can affect several countries, while the largest events can have global consequences. The hazards of supervolcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts could cause global disaster with threats to civilization and deaths of billions of people. Although these are very rare events, they will happen and require consideration. More frequent and smaller events in the wrong place at the wrong time could have very large human, environmental and economic effects.

@article{zachosRapidAcidificationOcean2005,
	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been attributed to the rapid release of ∼2000 × 109 metric tons of carbon in the form of methane. In theory, oxidation and ocean absorption of this carbon should have lowered deep-sea pH, thereby triggering a rapid ({\textless}10,000-year) shoaling of the calcite compensation depth (CCD), followed by gradual recovery. Here we present geochemical data from five new South Atlantic deep-sea sections that constrain the timing and extent of massive sea-floor carbonate dissolution coincident with the PETM. The sections, from between 2.7 and 4.8 kilometers water depth, are marked by a prominent clay layer, the character of which indicates that the CCD shoaled rapidly ({\textless}10,000 years) by more than 2 kilometers and recovered gradually ({\textgreater}100,000 years). These findings indicate that a large mass of carbon (»2000 × 109 metric tons of carbon) dissolved in the ocean at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and that permanent sequestration of this carbon occurred through silicate weathering feedback.
A dramatic increase in the dissolution of calcium carbonate at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum indicates that far more CO2 was added to the oceans than had been thought.

@article{buizertSouthernOceanControl2015,
	abstract = {Glacial periods exhibit abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) climatic oscillations that are thought to be linked to instabilities in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Great uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics of the DO cycle, as well as controls on the timing and duration of individual events. Using ice core data we show that the duration of warm (interstadial) periods is strongly correlated with Antarctic climate, and presumably with Southern Ocean (SO) temperature and the position of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerlies. We propose a SO control on AMOC stability and interstadial duration via the rate of Antarctic bottom water formation, meridional density/pressure gradients, Agulhas Leakage, and SO adiabatic upwelling. This hypothesis is supported by climate model experiments that demonstrate SO warming leads to a stronger AMOC that is less susceptible to freshwater perturbations. In the AMOC stability diagram, SO warming and strengthening of the SH westerlies both shift the vigorous AMOC branch toward higher freshwater values, thus raising the threshold for AMOC collapse. The proposed mechanism could provide a consistent explanation for several diverse observations, including maximum DO activity during intermediate ice volume/SH temperature, and successively shorter DO durations within each Bond cycle. It may further have implications for the fate of the AMOC under future global warming.},

While long associated directly or indirectly with the occurrence of the earliest complex animal fossils, a conclusive explanation for the formation and global extent of the Great Unconformity has remained elusive. Here we show that the Great Unconformity is associated with a set of large global oxygen and hafnium isotope excursions in magmatic zircon that suggest a late Neoproterozoic crustal erosion and sediment subduction event of unprecedented scale. These excursions, the Great Unconformity, preservational irregularities in the terrestrial bolide impact record, and the first-order pattern of Phanerozoic sedimentation can together be explained by spatially heterogeneous Neoproterozoic glacial erosion totaling a global average of 3--5 vertical kilometers, along with the subsequent thermal and isostatic consequences of this erosion for global continental freeboard.},

@article{wellerRelationshipMantlePotential2019,
	abstract = {The Earth's mantle potential temperature (TP) is thought to have cooled by ∼250∘C since the Archean, causing a progressive change in both the structure and composition of oceanic lithosphere. These variables affect the negative buoyancy of subducting slabs, which is known to be an important force in driving plate motions. However, the relationship between TP and slab buoyancy remains unclear. Here, we model the formation and subduction of oceanic lithosphere as a function of TP, to investigate how TP influences the buoyancy of subducting slabs, and by extension how buoyancy forces may have changed through time. First, we simulate isentropic melting of peridotite at mid-ocean ridges over a range of TP (1300--1550∘C) to calculate oceanic lithosphere structure and composition. Second, we model the thermal evolution of oceanic plates undergoing subduction for a variety of scenarios (by varying lithospheric thickness, slab length and subduction velocity). Finally, we integrate the structural, compositional and thermal constraints to forward model subduction metamorphism of oceanic plates to determine down-going slab density structures. When compared with ambient mantle, these models allow us to calculate buoyancy forces acting on subducting slabs. Our results indicate that oceanic lithosphere derived from hotter mantle has a greater negative buoyancy, and therefore subduction potential, than lithosphere derived from cooler mantle for a wide range of subduction scenarios. With respect to the early Earth, this conclusion supports the viability of subduction, and models of subduction zone initiation that invoke the concept of oceanic lithosphere being primed to subduct. However, we also show that decreases to lithosphere thickness and slab length, and reduced crustal hydration, progressively reduce slab negative buoyancy. These results highlight the need for robust estimates of early Earth lithospheric properties when considering whether subduction was operative at this time. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that subduction processes on the early Earth may have been uniformitarian.},

@article{edwardsRevisitingAntarcticIce2019,
	abstract = {Predictions for sea-level rise this century due to melt from Antarctica range from zero to more than one metre. The highest predictions are driven by the controversial marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) hypothesis, which assumes that coastal ice cliffs can rapidly collapse after ice shelves disintegrate, as a result of surface and sub-shelf melting caused by global warming. But MICI has not been observed in the modern era and it remains unclear whether it is required to reproduce sea-level variations in the geological past. Here we quantify ice-sheet modelling uncertainties for the original MICI study and show that the probability distributions are skewed towards lower values (under very high greenhouse gas concentrations, the most likely value is 45 centimetres). However, MICI is not required to reproduce sea-level changes due to Antarctic ice loss in the mid-Pliocene epoch, the last interglacial period or 1992--2017; without it we find that the projections agree with previous studies (all 95th percentiles are less than 43 centimetres). We conclude that previous interpretations of these MICI projections over-estimate sea-level rise this century; because the MICI hypothesis is not well constrained, confidence in projections with MICI would require a greater range of observationally constrained models of ice-shelf vulnerability and ice-cliff collapse.},

@article{gomezSealevelFeedbackLowers2015,
	abstract = {The stability of marine sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) in a warming climate has been identified as the largest source of uncertainty in projections of future sea-level rise. Sea-level fall near the grounding line of a retreating marine ice sheet has a stabilizing influence on the ice sheets, and previous studies have established the importance of this feedback on ice age AIS evolution. Here we use a coupled ice sheet--sea-level model to investigate the impact of the feedback mechanism on future AIS retreat over centennial and millennial timescales for a range of emission scenarios. We show that the combination of bedrock uplift and sea-surface drop associated with ice-sheet retreat significantly reduces AIS mass loss relative to a simulation without these effects included. Sensitivity analyses show that the stabilization tends to be greatest for lower emission scenarios and Earth models characterized by a thin elastic lithosphere and low-viscosity upper mantle, as is the case for West Antarctica.},

@article{yanTwomillionyearoldSnapshotsAtmospheric2019,
	abstract = {Over the past eight hundred thousand years, glacial--interglacial cycles oscillated with a period of one hundred thousand years (`100k world'1). Ice core and ocean sediment data have shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide, Antarctic temperature, deep ocean temperature, and global ice volume correlated strongly with each other in the 100k world2--6. Between about 2.8 and 1.2 million years ago, glacial cycles were smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration (`40k world'7). Proxy data from deep-sea sediments suggest that the variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 40k world was also lower than in the 100k world8--10, but we do not have direct observations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from this period. Here we report the recovery of stratigraphically discontinuous ice more than two million years old from the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, East Antarctica. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in ice core samples older than two million years have been altered by respiration, but some younger samples are pristine. The recovered ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and Antarctic temperature (based on the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratio δDice, a proxy for regional temperature) into the 40k world. All climate properties before eight hundred thousand years ago fall within the envelope of observations from continuous deep Antarctic ice cores that characterize the 100k world. However, the lowest measured carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and Antarctic temperature in the 40k world are well above glacial values from the past eight hundred thousand years. Our results confirm that the amplitudes of glacial--interglacial variations in atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic climate were reduced in the 40k world, and that the transition from the 40k to the 100k world was accompanied by a decline in minimum carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial maxima.},

The chronology is based on counting of annual layers observed in the chemical, dust and electrical conductivity records. These layers are caused by seasonal changes in the source, transport, and deposition of aerosols. The measurements were interpreted manually and with the aid of two automated methods. We validated the chronology by comparing to two high-accuracy, absolutely dated chronologies. For the Holocene, the cosmogenic isotope records of $^{\textrm{10}}$Be from WAIS Divide and $^{\textrm{14}}$C for IntCal13 demonstrated that WD2014 was consistently accurate to better than 0.5 \% of the age. For the glacial period, comparisons to the Hulu Cave chronology demonstrated that WD2014 had an accuracy of better than 1 \% of the age at three abrupt climate change events between 27 and 31 ka. WD2014 has consistently younger ages than Greenland ice core chronologies during most of the Holocene. For the Younger Dryas--Preboreal transition (11.595 ka; 24 years younger) and the B{\o}lling--Aller{\o}d Warming (14.621 ka; 7 years younger), WD2014 ages are within the combined uncertainties of the timescales. Given its high accuracy, WD2014 can become a reference chronology for the Southern Hemisphere, with synchronization to other chronologies feasible using high-quality proxies of volcanism, solar activity, atmospheric mineral dust, and atmospheric methane concentrations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{ruddimanEarlyAnthropogenicHypothesis2020,
	abstract = {The `early anthropogenic hypothesis' (EAH), published in 2003, proposed that early agricultural humans transformed planet Earth by adding CO2 to the atmosphere by deforestation after 7000 years ago and by adding CH4 to the atmosphere by wet-rice farming and livestock tending after 5000 years ago. Later work led to the insight that the resulting warming of the atmosphere and the ocean would have contributed additional CO2 feedback by reducing CO2 solubility in the global ocean and by boosting ventilation from the Antarctic Ocean surface due to suppressed Antarctic sea-ice extent. This paper summarizes new findings from multiple scientific disciplines that document how the steadily spreading human influence transformed their environment after 7000 years ago. We blend this new evidence into a revised version of the EAH, and we also evaluate proposed alternatives to the anthropogenic explanation.},

	abstract = {Columbia River megafloods occurred repeatedly during the last deglaciation, but the impacts of this fresh water on Pacific hydrography are largely unknown. To reconstruct changes in ocean circulation during this period, we used a numerical model to simulate the flow trajectory of Columbia River megafloods and compiled records of sea surface temperature, paleo-salinity, and deep-water radiocarbon from marine sediment cores in the Northeast Pacific. The North Pacific sea surface cooled and freshened during the early deglacial (19.0-16.5 ka) and Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka) intervals, coincident with the appearance of subsurface water masses depleted in radiocarbon relative to the sea surface. We infer that Pacific meltwater fluxes contributed to net Northern Hemisphere cooling prior to North Atlantic Heinrich Events, and again during the Younger Dryas stadial. Abrupt warming in the Northeast Pacific similarly contributed to hemispheric warming during the B{\o}lling and Holocene transitions. These findings underscore the importance of changes in North Pacific freshwater fluxes and circulation in deglacial climate events.},

	abstract = {An ocean of climate impacts
Large decreases in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation accompanied every one of the cold Northern Hemispheric stadial events that occurred during the heart of the last glacial period. These events, lasting on average around 1000 years each, have long been thought to result from changes in deep ocean circulation. Henry et al. used a suite of geochemical proxies from marine sediments to show that reductions in the export of northern deep waters occurred before and during stadial periods (see the Perspective by Schmittner). This observation firmly establishes the role of ocean circulation as a cause of abrupt glacial climate change during that interval.
Science, this issue p. 470; see also p. 445
The most recent ice age was characterized by rapid and hemispherically asynchronous climate oscillations, whose origin remains unresolved. Variations in oceanic meridional heat transport may contribute to these repeated climate changes, which were most pronounced during marine isotope stage 3, the glacial interval 25 thousand to 60 thousand years ago. We examined climate and ocean circulation proxies throughout this interval at high resolution in a deep North Atlantic sediment core, combining the kinematic tracer protactinium/thorium (Pa/Th) with the deep water-mass tracer, epibenthic δ13C. These indicators suggest reduced Atlantic overturning circulation during every cool northern stadial, with the greatest reductions during episodic Hudson Strait iceberg discharges, while sharp northern warming followed reinvigorated overturning. These results provide direct evidence for the ocean's persistent, central role in abrupt glacial climate change.
Deep ocean circulation changes preceded and accompanied the millennial cold climate events of the past ice age.

@article{bazinOptimizedMultiproxyMultisite2013,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} An accurate and coherent chronological framework is essential for the interpretation of climatic and environmental records obtained from deep polar ice cores. Until now, one common ice core age scale had been developed based on an inverse dating method (Datice), combining glaciological modelling with absolute and stratigraphic markers between 4 ice cores covering the last 50 ka (thousands of years before present) (Lemieux-Dudon et al., 2010). In this paper, together with the companion paper of Veres et al. (2013), we present an extension of this work back to 800 ka for the NGRIP, TALDICE, EDML, Vostok and EDC ice cores using an improved version of the Datice tool. The AICC2012 (Antarctic Ice Core Chronology 2012) chronology includes numerous new gas and ice stratigraphic links as well as improved evaluation of background and associated variance scenarios. This paper concentrates on the long timescales between 120--800 ka. In this framework, new measurements of δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O$_{\textrm{atm}}$ over Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11--12 on EDC and a complete δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O$_{\textrm{atm}}$ record of the TALDICE ice cores permit us to derive additional orbital gas age constraints. The coherency of the different orbitally deduced ages (from δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O$_{\textrm{atm}}$, δO$_{\textrm{2}}$/N$_{\textrm{2}}$ and air content) has been verified before implementation in AICC2012. The new chronology is now independent of other archives and shows only small differences, most of the time within the original uncertainty range calculated by Datice, when compared with the previous ice core reference age scale EDC3, the Dome F chronology, or using a comparison between speleothems and methane. For instance, the largest deviation between AICC2012 and EDC3 (5.4 ka) is obtained around MIS 12. Despite significant modifications of the chronological constraints around MIS 5, now independent of speleothem records in AICC2012, the date of Termination II is very close to the EDC3 one.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{palinSecularChangeOnset2020,
	abstract = {The Earth as a planetary system has experienced significant change since its formation c. 4.54 Gyr ago. Some of these changes have been gradual, such as secular cooling of the mantle, and some have been abrupt, such as the rapid increase in free oxygen in the atmosphere at the Archean--Proterozoic transition. Many of these changes have directly affected tectonic processes on Earth and are manifest by temporal trends within the sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock record. Indeed, the timing of global onset of mobile-lid (subduction-driven) plate tectonics on our planet remains one of the fundamental points of debate within the geosciences today, and constraining the age and cause of this transition has profound implications for understanding our own planet's long-term evolution, and that for other rocky bodies in our solar system. Interpretations based on various sources of evidence have led different authors to propose a very wide range of ages for the onset of subduction-driven tectonics, which span almost all of Earth history from the Hadean to the Neoproterozoic, with this uncertainty stemming from the varying reliability of different proxies. Here, we review evidence for paleo-subduction preserved within the geological record, with a focus on metamorphic rocks and the geodynamic information that can be derived from them. First, we describe the different types of tectonic/geodynamic regimes that may occur on Earth or any other silicate body, and then review different models for the thermal evolution of the Earth and the geodynamic conditions necessary for plate tectonics to stabilize on a rocky planet. The community's current understanding of the petrology and structure of Archean and Proterozoic oceanic and continental crust is then discussed in comparison with modern-day equivalents, including how and why they differ. We then summarize evidence for the operation of subduction through time, including petrological (metamorphic), tectonic, and geochemical/isotopic data, and the results of petrological and geodynamical modeling. The styles of metamorphism in the Archean are then examined and we discuss how the secular distribution of metamorphic rock types can inform the type of geodynamic regime that operated at any point in time. In conclusion, we argue that most independent observations from the geological record and results of lithospheric-scale geodynamic modeling support a global-scale initiation of plate tectonics no later than c. 3 Ga, just preceding the Archean--Proterozoic transition. Evidence for subduction in Early Archean terranes is likely accounted for by localized occurrences of plume-induced subduction initiation, although these did not develop into a stable, globally connected network of plate boundaries until later in Earth history. Finally, we provide a discussion of major unresolved questions related to this review's theme and provide suggested directions for future research.},

@article{mckenzieSpeculationsGenerationMovement2020,
	abstract = {The discovery of komatiites, first in South Africa and then in many other Archean greenstone belts, with MgO concentrations of 20--30\% and eruption temperatures of more than \$1600  C, showed that some parts of the mantle were hotter in the Archean than they are now. Since their discovery there have been many speculative proposals as to how such magmas can form. At present melt is produced by mantle upwelling, because the solidus temperature gradient of the mantle is steeper than that of isentropic decompression gradient at depths of less than 300 km. In contrast, in the lower half of the upper mantle the solidus gradient is shallower than the isentropic gradient, and, therefore, isentropic upwelling cannot generate melt. At the base of the upper mantle limited melting can occur, either in the thermal boundary layer at the base of the upper mantle, or in the upper part of the lower mantle where the solidus gradient is steeper than the isentropic gradient. In both cases melting can occur at depths of more than 600 km, where Ca perovskite, CaPv, is a stable phase on the solidus. A surprising feature of the partitioning between melt and solid CaPv is that most trace elements are compatible in the solid. Partitioning into CaPv can, therefore, account for the low concentrations of such elements in komatiites. The temperatures required to generate such magmas in plumes need be no more than \$50  C above those of Phanerozoic plumes.

	abstract = {Non-arc basalts of Archean and Proterozoic age have model primary magmas that exhibit mantle potential temperatures TP that increase from 1350 $\,^{\circ}$C at the present to a maximum of ∼ 1500--1600 $\,^{\circ}$C at 2.5--3.0 Ga. The overall trend of these temperatures converges smoothly to that of the present-day MORB source, supporting the interpretation that the non-arc basalts formed by the melting of hot ambient mantle, not mantle plumes, and that they can constrain the thermal history of the Earth. These petrological results are very similar to those predicted by thermal models characterized by a low Urey ratio and more sluggish mantle convection in the past. We infer that the mantle was warming in deep Archean--Hadean time because internal heating exceeded surface heat loss, and it has been cooling from 2.5 to 3.0 Ga to the present. Non-arc Precambrian basalts are likely to be similar to those that formed oceanic crust and erupted on continents. It is estimated that ∼ 25--35 km of oceanic crust formed in the ancient Earth by about 30\% melting of hot ambient mantle. In contrast, komatiite parental magmas reveal TP that are higher than those of non-arc basalts, consistent with the hot plume model. However, the associated excess magmatism was minor and oceanic plateaus, if they existed, would have had subtle bathymetric variations, unlike those of Phanerozoic oceanic plateaus. Primary magmas of Precambrian ambient mantle had 18--24\% MgO, and they left behind residues of harzburgite that are now found as xenoliths of cratonic mantle. We infer that primary basaltic partial melts having 10--13\% MgO are a feature of Phanerozoic magmatism, not of the early Earth, which may be why modern-day analogs of oceanic crust have not been reported in Archean greenstone belts.},

@article{daviesEvolutionarySynchronyEarth2020,
	abstract = {The landscapes and seascapes of Earth's surface provide the theatre for life, but to what extent did the actors build the stage? The role of life in the long-term shaping of the planetary surface needs to be understood to ascertain whether Earth is singular among known rocky planets, and to frame predictions of future changes to the biosphere. Modern geomorphic observations and modelling have made strides in this respect, but an underutilized lens through which to interrogate these questions resides in the most complete tangible record of our planetary history: the sedimentary-stratigraphic record (SSR). The characteristics of the SSR have been frequently explained with reference to changes in boundary conditions such as relative sea level, climate, and tectonics. Yet despite the fact that the long-term accrual of the SSR was contemporaneous with the evolution of almost all domains of life on Earth, causal explanations related to biological activity have often been overlooked, particularly within siliciclastic strata. This paper explores evidence for the ways in which organisms have influenced the SSR throughout Earth history and emphasizes that further investigation can help lead towards a mechanistic understanding of how the planetary surface has co-evolved with life. The practicality of discerning life signatures in the SSR is discussed by: 1) distinguishing biologically-dependent versus biologically-influenced sedimentary signatures; 2) emphasizing the importance of determining relative time-length scales of processes and demonstrating how different focal lengths of observation (individual geological outcrops and the complete SSR) can reveal different insights; and 3) promoting an awareness of issues of equifinality and underdetermination that may hinder the recognition of life signatures. Multiple instances of life signatures and their historic range within the SSR are reviewed, with examples covering siliciclastic, biogenic and chemogenic strata, and trigger organisms from across the spectrum of Earth's extant and ancient life. With this novel perspective, the SSR is recognised as a dynamic archive that expands and complements the fossil and geochemical records that it hosts, rather than simply being a passive repository for them. The SSR is shown to be both the record and the result of long-term evolutionary synchrony between life and planetary surface processes.},

@incollection{mcmahonShortageGeologicalEvidence2018,
	abstract = {Meandering rivers have been hypothesised to have been rare, or even absent, prior to the evolution of land plants. This is supported by experimental models that demonstrate how bank stability is essential for the development of sustained channel meanders and observations of modern rivers where many causes of bank stability involve direct or indirect biological stabilisation by vegetation. Further support is found in the geological record because overbank fines, heterolithic architectural complexity and laterally‐accreting inclined heterolithic stratification (LA‐IHS) are rarely observed in Precambrian and earliest Palaeozoic alluvium. An alternative view is that the development of meandering planforms in unvegetated tidal creeks, incised rivers and on other telluric planets and moons such as Mars and Titan, shows that meandering is possible in the absence of vegetation and, by extension, that meandering rivers may not have been uncommon on pre‐vegetation Earth. Further evidence for the existence of prevegetation meandering channels has come from a recent report of classic meandering fluvial facies in the Neoproterozoic Allt‐na‐B{\'e}iste Member of the Torridon Group, Scotland. This paper reviews how different types of evidence have been used to evaluate the commonness of pre‐vegetation meandering rivers, in order to identify where they are in agreement, and presents new field data from the Allt‐na‐B{\'e}iste Member that quantifies the dimensions and frequency of occurrence of classic meandering fluvial facies within the unit. The universal conclusion from different strands of evidence is that meandering rivers, particularly those with small‐sized to moderate‐sized channel dimensions, were much less common on Earth prior to the evolution of land plants. The pre‐vegetation example of classic meandering river facies in the Allt‐na‐B{\'e}iste Member is shown to be a minor component of regional stratigraphy that records the deposits of channels that were {\textless} 0.5 m‐deep and probably less than 3 m‐wide. It is anomalous in comparison with contemporaneous fluvial facies worldwide and appears to have developed due to highly localised controls in a near‐filled lake basin, where relatively high mud content and a low gradient mimicked the physical effects of plants.},

	abstract = {The sedimentary rock reservoir both records and influences changes in Earth's surface environment. Geoscientists extract data from the rock record to constrain long-term environmental, climatic and biological evolution, with the understanding that geological processes of erosion and rock destruction may have overprinted some aspects of their results. It has also long been recognized that changes in the mass and chemical composition of buried sediments, operating in conjunction with biologically catalyzed reactions, exert a first-order control on Earth surface conditions on geologic timescales. Thus, the construction and destruction of the rock record has the potential to influence both how Earth and life history are sampled, and drive long-term trends in surface conditions that otherwise are difficult to affect. However, directly testing what the dominant process signal in the sedimentary record is --- rock construction or destruction --- has rarely been undertaken, primarily due to the difficulty of assembling data on the mass and age of rocks in Earth's crust. Here, we present results on the chronological age and general properties of rocks and sediments in the Macrostrat geospatial database (https://macrostrat.org). Empirical patterns in surviving rock quantity as a function of age are indicative of both continual cycling (gross sedimentation) and long-term sediment accumulation (net sedimentation). Temporal variation in the net sedimentary reservoir was driven by major changes in the ability of continental crust to accommodate sediments. The implied history of episodic growth of sediment mass on continental crust has many attendant implications for the drivers of long-term biogeochemical evolution of Earth and life.},

@article{bradleySecularTrendsGeologic2011,
	abstract = {Geologic secular trends are used to refine the timetable of supercontinent assembly, tenure, and breakup. The analysis rests on what is meant by the term supercontinent, which here is defined broadly as a grouping of formerly dispersed continents. To avoid the artificial pitfall of an all-or-nothing definition, quantitative measures of ``supercontinentality'' are presented: the number of continents, and the area of the largest continent, which both can be gleaned from global paleogeographic maps for the Phanerozoic. For the secular trends approach to be viable in the deep past when the very existence of supercontinents is debatable and reconstructions are fraught with problems, it must first be calibrated in the Phanerozoic against the wellconstrained Pangea supercontinent cycle. The most informative geologic variables covering both the Phanerozoic and Precambrian are the abundances of passive margins and of detrital zircons. Both fluctuated with size of the largest continent during the Pangea supercontinent cycle and can be quantified back to the Neoarchean. The tenure of Pangea was a time represented in the rock record by few zircons and few passive margins. Thus, previously documented minima in the abundance of detrital zircons (and orogenic granites) during the Precambrian (Condie et al., 2009a, Gondwana Research 15, 228--242) now can be more confidently interpreted as marking the tenures of supercontinents. The occurrences of carbonatites, granulites, eclogites, and greenstone-belt deformation events also appear to bear the imprint of Precambrian supercontinent cyclicity. Together, these secular records are consistent with the following scenario. The Neoarchean continental assemblies of Superia and Sclavia broke up at ca. 2300 and ca. 2090 Ma, respectively. Some of their fragments collided to form Nuna by about 1750 Ma; Nuna then grew by lateral accretion of juvenile arcs during the Mesoproterozoic, and was involved in a series of collisions at ca. 1000 Ma to form Rodinia. Rodinia broke up in stages from ca. 1000 to ca. 520 Ma. Before Rodinia had completely come apart, some of its pieces had already been reassembled in a new configuration, Gondwana, which was completed by 530 Ma. Gondwana later collided with Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia to form Pangea by about 300 Ma. Breakup of Pangea began at about 180 Ma (Early Jurassic) and continues today. In the suggested scenario, no supercontinent cycle in Earth history corresponded to the ideal, in which all the continents were gathered together, then broke apart, then reassembled in a new configuration. Nuna and Gondwana ended their tenures not by breakup but by collision and name change; Rodinia's assembly overlapped in time with its disassembly; and Pangea spalled Tethyan microcontinents throughout much of its tenure. Many other secular trends show a weak or uneven imprint of the supercontinent cycle, no imprint at all. Instead, these secular trends together reveal aspects of the shifting background against which the supercontinents came and went, making each cycle unique. Global heat production declined; plate tectonics sped up through the Proterozoic and slowed down through the Phanerozoic; the atmosphere and oceans became oxidized; life emerged as a major geochemical agent; some rock types went extinct or nearly so (BIF, massif-type anorthosite, komatiite); and other rock types came into existence or became common (blueschists, bioclastic limestone, coal).},

              greenhouse gases, methane is measured quite routinely, while nitrous oxide is more challenging, with some artefacts occurring in the ice and so far limited interpretation. In the recent past, the ice cores provide the only direct measure of the changes that have occurred during the industrial period; they show that the current concentration of methane in the atmosphere is far outside the range experienced in the last 650 000 years; nitrous oxide is also elevated above its natural levels. There is controversy about whether changes in the pre-industrial Holocene are natural or anthropogenic in origin. Changes in wetland emissions are generally cited as the main cause of the large glacial--interglacial change in methane. However, changing sinks must also be considered, and the impact of possible newly described sources evaluated. Recent isotopic data appear to finally rule out any major impact of clathrate releases on methane at these time-scales. Any explanation must take into account that, at the rapid Dansgaard--Oeschger warmings of the last glacial period, methane rose by around half its glacial--interglacial range in only a few decades. The recent EPICA Dome C (Antarctica) record shows that methane tracked climate over the last 650 000 years, with lower methane concentrations in glacials than interglacials, and lower concentrations in cooler interglacials than in warmer ones. Nitrous oxide also shows Dansgaard--Oeschger and glacial--interglacial periodicity, but the pattern is less clear.},

	abstract = {The oxygen-isotope records from Greenland ice cores show a very strong, reproducible pattern of alternation between warm Greenland Interstadials (GI) and cold Greenland Stadials (GS) at millennial-scale during the last glacial period. Here we summarise what is known about this variability from ice core records. The typical cycle has a sawtooth pattern, with a very rapid warming event (occurring in a few decades), a slow cooling trend, and then a final fast cooling. 25 such events have been numbered in the last glacial. The recent GICC05 age scale provides the best available age scale that can be directly applied to this stratigraphy, and we summarise the timing of the warming events, and the length and strength of each event. The Greenland stratigraphy can be transferred to other records if we make assumptions about the contemporaneous nature of rapid events in different archives. Other parameters, such as the snow accumulation rate, and the concentration of terrestrial dust and sea salt recorded in the Greenland cores, also show a strong contrasting pattern between GI and GS. Methane concentrations are generally high during GI and lower during GS, with the increase from GS to GI occurring within a century. Antarctic ice cores show a different pattern: each GI has an Antarctic counterpart, but Antarctica appears to warm while Greenland is in a GS, and cool during GI. These changes are consistent with a mechanism involving ocean heat transport, but the rapid nature of warmings poses a challenge for modellers, while the rapid methane changes pose questions about the pattern of land biosphere emissions during the glacial that are also relevant for understanding glacial-interglacial methane variability.},

For the last glacial period, ice core studies have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard-Oeschger events in Greenland through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard-Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland, the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw6. The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {A simple, untuned ``constant sedimentation rate'' timescale developed using three radiometric age constraints and eleven δ18O records longer than 0.8 Myr provides strong support for the validity of the SPECMAP timescale of the late Quaternary [Imbrie et al., 1984]. In particular, the present study independently confirms the link between major deglaciations (terminations) and increases in northern hemisphere summer radiation at high latitudes and shows that this correlation is not an artifact of orbital tuning. In addition, the excess ice characteristic of late Quaternary ``100-kyr'' climate cycles typically accumulates when July insolation at 65$\,^{\circ}$N has been unusually low for more than a full precessional cycle, or {\textgreater}21 kyr, and once established does not last beyond the next increase in summer insolation. Thus, the timing of the growth and decay of large 100-kyr ice sheets, as depicted in the deep sea δ18O record, is strongly (and semipredictably) influenced by eccentricity through its modulation of the orbital precession component of northern hemisphere summer insolation.},

	abstract = {Executive SummaryGreenhouse-Gas Variations and Past Climate ResponsesIt is a fact that present-day (2011) concentrations of the atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) exceed the range of concentrations recorded in ice cores during the past 800,000 years. Past changes in atmospheric GHG concentrations can be determined with very high confidence from polar ice cores. Since AR4 these records have been extended from 650,000 years to 800,000 years ago. \{5.2.2\}With very high confidence, the current rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O rise in atmospheric concentrations and the associated radiative forcing are unprecedented with respect to the highest resolution ice core records of the last 22,000 years. There is medium confidence that the rate of change of the observed GHG rise is also unprecedented compared with the lower resolution records of the past 800,000 years. \{5.2.2\}There is high confidence that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration play an important role in glacial--interglacial cycles. Although the primary driver of glacial--interglacial cycles lies in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy driven by changes in the geometry of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (``orbital forcing''), reconstructions and simulations together show that the full magnitude of glacial--interglacial temperature and ice volume changes cannot be explained without accounting for changes in atmospheric CO2 content and the associated climate feedbacks. During the last deglaciation, it is very likely that global mean temperature increased by 3$\,^{\circ}$C to 8$\,^{\circ}$C.},

@article{dentonLastGlacialTermination2010,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A major puzzle of paleoclimatology is why, after a long interval of cooling climate, each late Quaternary ice age ended with a relatively short warming leg called a termination. We here offer a comprehensive hypothesis of how Earth emerged from the last global ice age. A prerequisite was the growth of very large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, whose subsequent collapse created stadial conditions that disrupted global patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation. The Southern Hemisphere westerlies shifted poleward during each northern stadial, producing pulses of ocean upwelling and warming that together accounted for much of the termination in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Rising atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ during southern upwelling pulses augmented warming during the last termination in both polar hemispheres.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{parreninSynchronousChangeAtmospheric2013,
	abstract = {No Leader to Follow
Changes in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and surface air temperature are closely related. However, temperature can influence atmospheric CO2 as well as be influenced by it. Studies of polar ice cores have concluded that temperature increases during periods of rapid warming have preceded increases in CO2 by hundreds of years. Parrenin et al. (p. 1060; see the Perspective by Brook) present a revised age scale for the atmospheric component of Antarctic ice cores, based on the isotopic composition of the N2 that they contain, and suggest that temperature and CO2 changed synchronously over four intervals of rapid warming during the last deglaciation.
Understanding the role of atmospheric CO2 during past climate changes requires clear knowledge of how it varies in time relative to temperature. Antarctic ice cores preserve highly resolved records of atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperature for the past 800,000 years. Here we propose a revised relative age scale for the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperature for the last deglacial warming, using data from five Antarctic ice cores. We infer the phasing between CO2 concentration and Antarctic temperature at four times when their trends change abruptly. We find no significant asynchrony between them, indicating that Antarctic temperature did not begin to rise hundreds of years before the concentration of atmospheric CO2, as has been suggested by earlier studies.
Rising air temperature did not lead the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration during the last deglaciation. [Also see Perspective by Brook]

@article{shakunGlobalWarmingPreceded2012,
	abstract = {The covariation of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature in Antarctic ice-core records suggests a close link between CO2 and climate during the Pleistocene ice ages. The role and relative importance of CO2 in producing these climate changes remains unclear, however, in part because the ice-core deuterium record reflects local rather than global temperature. Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.},

	abstract = {The tropical impact of iceberg armadas
The massive discharges of icebergs from the Greenland ice sheet during the Last Glacial Period are called Heinrich events. But did Heinrich events cause abrupt climate change, or were they a product of it? Methane levels represent a proxy for climate, because methane production increases mostly due to wetter conditions in the tropics. Rhodes et al. report a highly resolved record of atmospheric methane concentrations, derived from an ice core from Antarctica. Methane levels varied---i.e., the tropical climate changed---in response to cooling in the Northern Hemisphere caused by Heinrich events.
Science, this issue p. 1016
The causal mechanisms responsible for the abrupt climate changes of the Last Glacial Period remain unclear. One major difficulty is dating ice-rafted debris deposits associated with Heinrich events: Extensive iceberg influxes into the North Atlantic Ocean linked to global impacts on climate and biogeochemistry. In a new ice core record of atmospheric methane with ultrahigh temporal resolution, we find abrupt methane increases within Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4, and 5 that, uniquely, have no counterparts in Greenland temperature proxies. Using a heuristic model of tropical rainfall distribution, we propose that Hudson Strait Heinrich events caused rainfall intensification over Southern Hemisphere land areas, thereby producing excess methane in tropical wetlands. Our findings suggest that the climatic impacts of Heinrich events persisted for 740 to 1520 years.
Intense production of icebergs from the Greenland Ice Sheet fueled tropical methane production.

Greenland surface air temperatures changed dramatically during the last deglaciation. The exact amount is unknown, which makes it difficult to understand what caused those changes. Buizert et al. report temperature reconstructions for the period from 19,000 to 10,000 years before the present from three different locations in Greenland and interpret them with a climate model (see the Perspective by Sime). They provide the broad geographic pattern of temperature variability and infer the mechanisms of the changes and their seasonality, which differ in important ways from the traditional view.
Science, this issue p. 1177; see also p. 1116
Greenland ice core water isotopic composition (δ18O) provides detailed evidence for abrupt climate changes but is by itself insufficient for quantitative reconstruction of past temperatures and their spatial patterns. We investigate Greenland temperature evolution during the last deglaciation using independent reconstructions from three ice cores and simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model. Contrary to the traditional δ18O interpretation, the Younger Dryas period was 4.5$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 2$\,^{\circ}$C warmer than the Oldest Dryas, due to increased carbon dioxide forcing and summer insolation. The magnitude of abrupt temperature changes is larger in central Greenland (9$\,^{\circ}$ to 14$\,^{\circ}$C) than in the northwest (5$\,^{\circ}$ to 9$\,^{\circ}$C), fingerprinting a North Atlantic origin. Simulated changes in temperature seasonality closely track changes in the Atlantic overturning strength and support the hypothesis that abrupt climate change is mostly a winter phenomenon.

One problem is that an abrupt increase in the AMOC during the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d (BA) transition occurred when the melting of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets was significant, which tended to weaken the AMOC. Here, from transient simulations of the last deglaciation using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, we show that an abrupt increase in the AMOC during the BA transition could occur without reduction in glacial meltwater. The abrupt increase in the AMOC accompanied abrupt warming in Greenland and sea ice retreat in the North Atlantic, consistent with proxies and previous modeling studies. The results imply that abrupt BA warming during the middle stage of the last deglaciation was a response to gradual warming under the presence of meltwater from continental ice sheets.},

@article{markleGlobalAtmosphericTeleconnections2017,
	abstract = {During the last glacial period, the North Atlantic region experienced a series of Dansgaard--Oeschger cycles in which climate abruptly alternated between warm and cold periods. Corresponding variations in Antarctic surface temperature were out of phase with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The temperature relationship between the hemispheres is commonly attributed to an interhemispheric redistribution of heat by the ocean overturning circulation. Changes in ocean heat transport should be accompanied by changes in atmospheric circulation to satisfy global energy budget constraints. Although changes in tropical atmospheric circulation linked to abrupt events in the Northern Hemisphere are well documented, evidence for predicted changes in the Southern Hemisphere's atmospheric circulation during Dansgaard--Oeschger cycles is lacking. Here we use a high-resolution deuterium-excess record from West Antarctica to show that the latitude of the mean moisture source for Antarctic precipitation changed in phase with abrupt shifts in Northern Hemisphere climate, and significantly before Antarctic temperature change. This provides direct evidence that Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks shifted within decades of abrupt changes in the North Atlantic, in parallel with meridional migrations of the intertropical convergence zone. We conclude that both oceanic and atmospheric processes, operating on different timescales, link the hemispheres during abrupt climate change.},

@article{savastanoRealTimeDetectionTsunami2017,
	abstract = {It is well known that tsunamis can produce gravity waves that propagate up to the ionosphere generating disturbed electron densities in the E and F regions. These ionospheric disturbances can be studied in detail using ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measurements collected by continuously operating ground-based receivers from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Here, we present results using a new approach, named VARION (Variometric Approach for Real-Time Ionosphere Observation), and estimate slant TEC (sTEC) variations in a real-time scenario. Using the VARION algorithm we compute TEC variations at 56 GPS receivers in Hawaii as induced by the 2012 Haida Gwaii tsunami event. We observe TEC perturbations with amplitudes of up to 0.25 TEC units and traveling ionospheric perturbations (TIDs) moving away from the earthquake epicenter at an approximate speed of 316 m/s. We perform a wavelet analysis to analyze localized variations of power in the TEC time series and we find perturbation periods consistent with a tsunami typical deep ocean period. Finally, we present comparisons with the real-time tsunami MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) model produced by the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research and we observe variations in TEC that correlate in time and space with the tsunami waves.},

@article{zafaraniSeismicHazardAnalysis2020,
	abstract = {A strong earthquake occurred on November 12, 2017, in Sarpol-e Zahab city, western Iran, with the moment magnitude ( Mw ) of 7.3 and a focal depth of 18 km. The maximum horizontal peak ground acceleration of 0.69 g was recorded at the Sarpol-e Zahab station. Significant damages were observed in frame and masonry buildings, while the damage distribution was non-uniform throughout this small city. The preliminary site reconnaissance revealed that numerous engineering structures collapsed or considerably damaged in some regions, contrary with those non-structural masonry buildings in other regions which remained intact during earthquake. This paper represents a preliminary reconnaissance report prepared through the site visit done by the authors, a few days following the earthquake occurrence. Then, the data recorded by the strong ground motion stations in the affected city and the surrounding regions together with the geotechnical data gathered from the available boreholes in Sarpol-e Zahab are incorporated for probabilistic seismic hazard and local site effect analyses. The observed response spectra at two stations and distance-dependency of ground acceleration are compared with those predicted by some attenuation models. The results of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the return periods of 475 and 2475 years are compared with the observed ground response and the design spectra recommended by the Iranian seismic code (for site classes Types I and II). Several geotechnical boreholes from the previous works in the affected area were analyzed through the equivalent-linear site response approach in order to obtain the seismic response at the soil surface. The results are then compared with the code design spectra for the site classes of Types III and IV. It is demonstrated that the calculated response spectra are generally larger than those recommended by the Iranian seismic code, especially for the 4--7 stories buildings.},

@article{sparksForecastingVolcanicEruptions2003,
	abstract = {Forecasting is a central goal of volcanology. Intensive monitoring of recent eruptions has generated integrated timeseries of data, which have resulted in several successful examples of warnings being issued on impending eruptions. Ability to forecast is being advanced by new technology, such as broad-band seismology, satellite observations of ground deformation and improved field spectrometers for volcanic gas studies, and spectacular advances in computer power and speed, leading to improvements in data transmission, data analysis and modelling techniques. Analytical studies of volcanic samples, experimental investigations and theoretical modelling are providing insights into the dynamics of magmatic systems, giving a physical framework with which to interpret volcanic phenomena. Magmas undergo profound changes in physical properties as pressure and temperature vary during magma chamber evolution, magma ascent and eruption. Degassing and cooling during magma ascent induce crystallisation and increases of viscosity, strength and compressibility, commonly by several orders of magnitude. Active magmatic systems also interact strongly with their surroundings, causing ground deformation, material failure and other effects such as disturbed groundwater systems and degassing. These processes and interactions lead to geophysical and phenomenological effects, which precede and accompany eruptions. Forecasting of hazardous volcanic phenomena is becoming more quantitative and based on understanding of the physics of the causative processes. Forecasting is evolving from empirical pattern recognition to forecasting based on models of the underlying dynamics. The coupling of highly non-linear and complex kinetic and dynamic processes leads to a rich range of behaviours. Due to intrinsic uncertainties and the complexity of non-linear systems, precise prediction is usually not achievable. Forecasts of eruptions and hazards need to be expressed in probabilistic terms that take account of uncertainties.},

@article{voight1985NevadoRuiz1990,
	abstract = {This paper seeks to analyze in an objective way the circumstances and events that contributed to the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz catastrophe, in order to provide useful guidelines for future emergencies. The paper is organized into two principal parts. In the first part, an Anatomy of the catastrophe is developed as a step-by-step chronicle of events and actions taken by individuals and organizations during the period November 1984 through November 1985. This chronicle provides the essential background for the crucial events of November 13. This year-long period is broken down further to emphasize essential chapters: the gradual awareness of the awakening of the volcano; a long period of institutional skepticism reflecting an absence of credibility; the closure of the credibility gap with the September 11 phreatic eruption, followed by an intensive effort to gird for the worst; and a detailed account of the day of reckoning. The second part of the paper, Retrospection, examines the numerous complicated factors that influenced the catastrophic outcome, and attempts to cull a few ``lessons from Armero'' in order to avoid similar occurrences in the future. In a nutshell, the government on the whole acted responsibly but was not willing to bear the economic or political costs of early evacuation or a false alarm. Science accurately foresaw the hazards but was insufficiently precise to render reliable warning of the crucial event at the last possible minute. Catastrophe was therefore a calculated risk, and this combination --- the limitations of predication/detection, the refusal to bear a false alarm and the lack of will to act on the uncertain information available --- provided its immediate and most obvious causes. But because the crucial event occurred just two days before the Armero emergency-management plan was to be critically examined and improved, the numerous circumstances which delayed progress of emergency management over the previous year also may be said to have contributed to the outcome. Thus the catastrophe was not caused by technological ineffectiveness or detectiveness, nor by an overwhelming eruption, or by an improbable run of bad luck, but rather by cumulative human error --- by misjudgment, indecision and bureaucratic shortsightedness. Armero could have produces no victims, and therein dwells its immense tragedy.},

@article{galbraithLowerLimitAtmospheric2017,
	abstract = {Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied widely over the glacial cycles of the past 800,000 years. But despite this variability, Antarctic ice cores have shown that CO2 concentrations were very similar during all the coldest points of these cycles. Remarkably, the recurring minimum CO2 concentrations (190 $\pm$ 7 ppm) fall on the lower bound of any known in Earth history. Here we show that although the volume of terrestrial ice sheets was normally distributed over the past 800,000 years, as might be expected from the approximately normal distribution of the orbital forcing that drove the glacial cycles, Antarctic temperatures have a strong cold mode, whereas CO2 concentrations have both a cold mode and a central mode. Although multiple explanations are possible, the recurring CO2 minima and pronounced cold modes are consistent with a strong negative feedback to decreasing CO2 that resisted further cooling on timescales shorter than 10,000 years. We suggest that one possible negative feedback is CO2-limitation of photosynthesis, either directly or via CO2-limitation of N2 fixation, which could have inhibited further lowering of CO2 by reducing carbon storage.},

@article{ritzNobleGasesProxies2011,
	abstract = {Past global mean ocean temperature may be reconstructed from measurements of atmospheric noble gas concentrations in ice core bubbles. Assuming conservation of noble gases in the atmosphere-ocean system, the total concentration within the ocean mostly depends on solubility which itself is temperature dependent. Therefore, the colder the ocean, the more gas can be dissolved and the less remains in the atmosphere. Here, the characteristics of this novel paleoclimatic proxy are explored by implementing krypton, xenon, argon, and N2 into a reduced-complexity climate model. The relationship between noble gas concentrations and global mean ocean temperature is investigated and their sensitivities to changes in ocean volume, ocean salinity, sea-level pressure and geothermal heat flux are quantified. We conclude that atmospheric noble gas concentrations are suitable proxies of global mean ocean temperature. Changes in ocean volume need to be considered when reconstructing ocean temperatures from noble gases. Calibration curves are provided to translate ice-core measurements of krypton, xenon, and argon into a global mean ocean temperature change. Simulated noble gas-to-nitrogen ratios for the last glacial maximum are δKratm = −1.10‰, δXeatm = −3.25‰, and δAratm = −0.29‰. The uncertainty of the krypton calibration curve due to uncertainties of the ocean saturation concentrations is estimated to be $\pm$0.3 $\,^{\circ}$C. An additional $\pm$0.3 $\,^{\circ}$C uncertainty must be added for the last deglaciation and up to $\pm$0.4 $\,^{\circ}$C for earlier transitions due to age-scale uncertainties in the sea-level reconstructions. Finally, the fingerprint of idealized Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the atmospheric krypton-to-nitrogen ratio is presented. A δKratm change of up to 0.34‰ is simulated for a 2 kyr Dansgaard-Oeschger event, and a change of up to 0.48‰ is simulated for a 4 kyr event.},

@article{baggenstosEarthRadiativeImbalance2019,
	abstract = {The energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere determines the temporal evolution of the global climate, and vice versa changes in the climate system can alter the planetary energy fluxes. This interplay is fundamental to our understanding of Earth's heat budget and the climate system. However, even today, the direct measurement of global radiative fluxes is difficult, such that most assessments are based on changes in the total energy content of the climate system. We apply the same approach to estimate the long-term evolution of Earth's radiative imbalance in the past. New measurements of noble gas-derived mean ocean temperature from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C ice core covering the last 40,000 y, combined with recent results from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core and the sea-level record, allow us to quantitatively reconstruct the history of the climate system energy budget. The temporal derivative of this quantity must be equal to the planetary radiative imbalance. During the deglaciation, a positive imbalance of typically +0.2 W⋅m−2 is maintained for ∼10,000 y, however, with two distinct peaks that reach up to 0.4 W⋅m−2 during times of substantially reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We conclude that these peaks are related to net changes in ocean heat uptake, likely due to rapid changes in North Atlantic deep-water formation and their impact on the global radiative balance, while changes in cloud coverage, albeit uncertain, may also factor into the picture.},

@article{resplandyQuantificationOceanHeat2019,
	abstract = {The ocean is the main source of thermal inertia in the climate system. Ocean heat uptake during recent decades has been quantified using ocean temperature measurements. However, these estimates all use the same imperfect ocean dataset and share additional uncertainty due to sparse coverage, especially before 2007. Here, we provide an independent estimate by using measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) -- levels of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases -- as a whole ocean thermometer. We show that the ocean gained 1.29 $\pm$ 0.79 × 1022 Joules of heat per year between 1991 and 2016, equivalent to a planetary energy imbalance of 0.80 $\pm$ 0.49 W watts per square metre of Earth's surface. We also find that the ocean-warming effect that led to the outgassing of O2 and CO2 can be isolated from the direct effects of anthropogenic emissions and CO2 sinks. Our result -- which relies on high-precision O2 atmospheric measurements dating back to 1991 -- leverages an integrative Earth system approach and provides much needed independent confirmation of heat uptake estimated from ocean data.},

	abstract = {Hearing the heat
Most of the excess heat that causes global warming is absorbed by the oceans. Quantifying that heat increase is challenging because it requires many different temperature measurements over both the vertical and horizontal extent of the oceans. Wu et al. report success in this effort through the use of a different method: They inferred temperature changes from sound waves generated by repeating earthquakes (see the Perspective by Wunsch). The travel time of these earthquakes from source to receiver reflects changes in the average water temperature that they encounter. This technique should substantially enhance our ability to monitor ocean warming.
Science, this issue p. 1510; see also p. 1433
More than 90\% of the energy trapped on Earth by increasingly abundant greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean. Monitoring the resulting ocean warming remains a challenging sampling problem. To complement existing point measurements, we introduce a method that infers basin-scale deep-ocean temperature changes from the travel times of sound waves that are generated by repeating earthquakes. A first implementation of this seismic ocean thermometry constrains temperature anomalies averaged across a 3000-kilometer-long section in the equatorial East Indian Ocean with a standard error of 0.0060 kelvin. Between 2005 and 2016, we find temperature fluctuations on time scales of 12 months, 6 months, and {\textasciitilde}10 days, and we infer a decadal warming trend that substantially exceeds previous estimates.
Global seismic ocean thermometry using noise from earthquakes provides a distinct means of measuring ocean warming.

@article{rohlingComparingClimateSensitivity2018,
	abstract = {Climate sensitivity represents the global mean temperature change caused by changes in the radiative balance of climate; it is studied for both present/future (actuo) and past (paleo) climate variations, with the former based on instrumental records and/or various types of model simulations. Paleo-estimates are often considered informative for assessments of actuo-climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse forcing, but this utility remains debated because of concerns about the impacts of uncertainties, assumptions, and incomplete knowledge about controlling mechanisms in the dynamic climate system, with its multiple interacting feedbacks and their potential dependence on the climate background state. This is exacerbated by the need to assess actuo- and paleoclimate sensitivity over different timescales, with different drivers, and with different (data and/or model) limitations. Here, we visualize these impacts with idealized representations that graphically illustrate the nature of time-dependent actuo- and paleoclimate sensitivity estimates, evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, agreements, and differences of the two approaches. We also highlight priorities for future research to improve the use of paleo-estimates in evaluations of current climate change.},

@article{hiltonMountainsErosionCarbon2020,
	abstract = {Mountain building results in high erosion rates and the interaction of rocks with the atmosphere, water and life. Carbon transfers that result from increased erosion could control the evolution of Earth's long-term climate. For decades, attention has focused on the hypothesized role of mountain building in drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via silicate weathering. However, it is now recognized that mountain building and erosion affect the carbon cycle in other important ways. For example, erosion mobilizes organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial vegetation, transferring it to rivers and sediments, and thereby acting to draw down atmospheric CO2 in tandem with silicate weathering. Meanwhile, exhumation of sedimentary rocks can release CO2 through the oxidation of rock OC and sulfide minerals. In this Review, we examine the mechanisms of carbon exchange between rocks and the atmosphere, and discuss the balance of CO2 sources and sinks. It is demonstrated that OC burial and oxidative weathering, not widely considered in most models, control the net CO2 budget associated with erosion. Lithology strongly influences the impact of mountain building on the global carbon cycle, with an orogeny dominated by sedimentary rocks, and thus abundant rock OC and sulfides, tending towards being a CO2 source.},

@article{harperMagnitudeSurfaceOcean2020,
	abstract = {Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM‐2; 54.1 Ma) was the second largest Eocene hyperthermal. Like the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), ETM‐2 was characterized by massive carbon emissions and several degrees of global warming and thus can serve as a case study for assessing the impacts of rapid CO2 emissions on ocean carbonate chemistry, biota, and climate. Marine carbonate records of ETM‐2 are better preserved than those of the PETM due to more subdued carbonate dissolution. As yet, however, the magnitude of this carbon cycle perturbation has not been well constrained. Here, we present the first records of surface ocean acidification for ETM‐2, based on stable boron isotope records in mixed‐layer planktic foraminifera from two midlatitude ODP sites (1210 in the North Pacific and 1265 in the SE Atlantic), which indicate conservative minimum global sea surface acidification of −0.20 +0.12/−0.13 pH units. Using these estimates of pH and temperature as constraints on carbon cycle model simulations, we conclude that the total mass of C, released over a period of 15 to 25 kyr during ETM‐2, likely ranged from 2,600 to 3,800 Gt C, which is greater than previously estimated on the basis of other observations (i.e., stable carbon isotopes and carbonate compensation depth) alone.},

@article{gingerichTemporalScalingCarbon2019,
	abstract = {The Paleocene‐Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was caused by a massive release of carbon to the atmosphere. This is a benchmark global greenhouse warming event that raised temperatures to their warmest since extinction of the dinosaurs. Rates of carbon emission today can be compared to those during onset of the PETM in two ways: (1) projection of long‐term PETM rates for comparison on an annual time scale and (2) projection of short‐term modern rates for comparison on a PETM time scale. Both require temporal scaling and extrapolation for comparison on the same time scale. PETM rates are few and projection to a short time scale is poorly constrained. Modern rates are many, and projection to a longer PETM time scale is tightly constrained---modern rates are some 9--10 times higher than those during onset of the PETM. If the present trend of anthropogenic emissions continues, we can expect to reach a PETM‐scale accumulation of atmospheric carbon in as few as 140 to 259 years (about 5 to 10 human generations). Plain Language Summary The Paleocene‐Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is a global greenhouse warming event that happened 56 million years ago, causing extinction in the world's oceans and accelerated evolution on the continents. It was caused by release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. When we compare the rate of release of greenhouse gases today to the rate of accumulation during the PETM, we must compare the rates on a common time scale. Projection of modern rates to a PETM time scale is tightly constrained and shows that we are now emitting carbon some 9--10 times faster than during the PETM. If the present trend of increasing carbon emissions continues, we may see PETM‐magnitude extinction and accelerated evolution in as few as 140 years or about five human generations.},

	abstract = {Losses from earthquakes continue to rise despite increasingly sophisticated methods to estimate seismic risk throughout the world. This article discusses five specific reasons why this should be. Loss of life is most pronounced in the developing nations where three factors -- poverty, corruption and ignorance -- conspire to reduce the effective application of seismic resistant codes. A fourth reason is that in many developing nations the application of seismic resistant construction is inadvertently restricted to wealthy, or civil segments of the community, and is either unobtainable or irrelevant to the most vulnerable segment of the public --- the owner/occupiers of substandard dwellings. A fifth flaw in current seismic hazard studies is that sophisticated methodologies to evaluate risk are inappropriate in regions where strain rates are low, and where historical data are short compared to the return time of damaging earthquakes. The scientific community has remained largely unaware of the importance of these impediments to the development and application of appropriate seismic resistant code, and is ill-equipped to address them.},

@article{chen2008WenchuanEarthquake2010,
	abstract = {For historical reasons, earthquake prediction in China is government sanctioned and law regulated. During 1966--1976, coinciding with the political and social turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, there was an explosion of earthquake prediction. Enthusiasm climaxed with the prediction of the 1975 Haicheng earthquake, a prediction that was due mainly to the occurrence of an unusually pronounced foreshock sequence and the extraordinary readiness of some local officials of the time to issue imminent warning. Since the catastrophic Tangshan earthquake in 1976, there has been diminishing confidence in prediction and increasing emphasis on seismic risk mitigation. The Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May 2008 once again demonstrated the gloomy reality of earthquake prediction. In spite of the installation of massive precursor monitoring networks and an elaborate schedule of prediction conferences, no anomalous pattern was identified before this earthquake that would have enabled its prediction. Instead, the Wenchuan earthquake overwhelmingly demonstrated the vital importance of seismic risk mitigation. Different from Tangshan 1976, where seismic design was not required, such design was required for the Wenchuan area in 2008. Buildings that met the design standard suffered much less damage than those that did not. Notwithstanding, progress in practice lagged far behind the promulgation of regulations; stricter enforcement of seismic design provisions and wiser selection of construction sites would have prevented many deaths and greatly reduced the destruction of property. The prediction program in China has provided useful experience and taught many lessons. The most important lesson is that, regardless of its future potential, it is presently impractical to rely on prediction to prevent earthquake disasters. The practical approach is to strengthen the resilience of our built environment based on an assessment of seismic hazard.},

@article{wangPredicting1975Haicheng2006,
	abstract = {The publicized four-stage (long-term, middle-term, short-term, and imminent) prediction of the M 7.3 1975 Haicheng, China, earthquake once generated worldwide fascination. Yet the prediction process has remained mysterious because of lack of reports on real-time documentation and details of how warnings were issued. In the present work, study of declassified Chinese documents and interviews of key witnesses have allowed us to reconstruct this important history. Our findings indicate that there were two official middle-term predictions but no official shortterm prediction. On the day of the earthquake, a county government issued a specific evacuation order, and actual actions taken by provincial scientists and government officials also effectively constituted an imminent prediction. These efforts saved thousands of lives, but the local construction style and time of the earthquake also contributed to minimizing fatalities. Evacuation was extremely uneven across the disaster region, and critical decisions were often made at very local levels. The most important precursor was a foreshock sequence, but other anomalies such as geodetic deformation, changes in groundwater level, color, and chemistry, and peculiar animal behavior also played a role.},

@article{howellLateHoloceneUplift2015,
	abstract = {Several large earthquakes in the Hellenic subduction zone have been documented in historical records from around the eastern Mediterranean, but the relative seismic quiescence of the region over the period of instrumental observation means that the exact locations of these earthquakes and their tectonic significance are not known. We present AMS radiocarbon dates from uplifted late Holocene pal{\ae}oshorelines from the island of Rhodes, showing that uplift is most consistent with a single large (MW ≥ 7.7) reverse-faulting earthquake between about 2000 BC and 200 BC. Analysis of the uplift treating the earthquake as a dislocation in an elastic half-space shows a predominantly reverse-faulting event with a slip vector oblique to the direction of convergence between Rhodes and Nubia. We suggest that the fault responsible for the uplift dips at an angle of 30--60$\,^{\circ}$ above the more gently dipping oblique subduction interface. The highly oblique convergence across the eastern Hellenic plate boundary zone appears to be partitioned into reverse slip on faults that strike parallel to the boundary and strike-parallel or oblique slip on the subduction interface. Hydrodynamical simulation of tsunami propagation from a range of tectonically plausible sources suggests that earthquakes on the fault uplifting Rhodes represent a significant tsunami hazard for Rhodes and SW Turkey, and also possibly for Cyprus and the Nile Delta.},

@article{shawEasternMediterraneanTectonics2008,
	abstract = {Historical accounts describe an earthquake and tsunami on 21 July AD 365 that destroyed cities and drowned thousands of people in coastal regions from the Nile Delta to modern-day Dubrovnik. The location and tectonic setting of this earthquake have been uncertain until now. Here, we present evidence from radiocarbon data and field observations that western Crete was lifted above sea level, by up to 10 m, synchronously with the AD 365 earthquake. The distribution of uplift, combined with observations of present-day seismicity, suggest that this earthquake occurred not on the subduction interface beneath Crete, but on a fault dipping at about 30∘ within the overriding plate. Calculations of tsunami propagation show that the uplift of the sea floor associated with such an earthquake would have generated a damaging tsunami through much of the eastern Mediterranean. Measurement of the present rate of crustal shortening near Crete yields an estimate of ∼5,000 yr for the repeat time of tsunamigenic events on this single fault in western Crete, but if the same process takes place along the entire Hellenic subduction zone, such events may occur approximately once every 800 yr.},

              of sediment and rock are ubiquitous in submarine settings ranging from the steepest volcanic island slopes to the gentlest muddy slopes of submarine deltas. Here, we summarize current knowledge of such landslides and the problems of assessing their hazard potential. The major hazards related to submarine landslides include destruction of seabed infrastructure, collapse of coastal areas into the sea and landslide-generated tsunamis. Most submarine slopes are inherently stable. Elevated pore pressures (leading to decreased frictional resistance to sliding) and specific weak layers within stratified sequences appear to be the key factors influencing landslide occurrence. Elevated pore pressures can result from normal depositional processes or from transient processes such as earthquake shaking; historical evidence suggests that the majority of large submarine landslides are triggered by earthquakes. Because of their tsunamigenic potential, ocean-island flank collapses and rockslides in fjords have been identified as the most dangerous of all landslide related hazards. Published models of ocean-island landslides mainly examine `worst-case scenarios' that have a low probability of occurrence. Areas prone to submarine landsliding are relatively easy to identify, but we are still some way from being able to forecast individual events with precision. Monitoring of critical areas where landslides might be imminent and modelling landslide consequences so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be developed would appear to be areas where advances on current practice are possible.},

@article{eisslerSingleforceModel19751987,
	abstract = {A single force mechanism is investigated as the source of long-period seismic radiation from the 1975 Kalapana, Hawaii, earthquake (MS = 7.1). The observed Love wave radiation pattern determined from the spectra of World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network and High Gain Long Period records at 100 s is two-lobed with azimuth, consistent with a near-horizontal single force acting opposite (strike ∼330$\,^{\circ}$) to the observed displacement direction of the earthquake; this pattern is inconsistent with the expected double-couple pattern. Assuming a form of the force time history of a one-cycle sinusoid, the total duration of the event estimated from Rayleigh waves at two International Deployment of Accelerometers stations is approximately 180 s. The peak amplitude fo of the time function is 1 × 1015 N from amplitudes of Love and Rayleigh waves. The interpretation is that the bulk of the seismic radiation was produced by large-scale slumping of a large area of the south flank of Kilauea volcano. The single force is a crude representation of the effect on the earth of the motion of a partially decoupled large slide mass. Using the mass estimated from the tsunami generation area (∼ 1015--1016 kg), the peak acceleration of the slide block (0.1--1 m s−2) inferred from the seismic force is comparable with the acceleration due to gravity on a gently inclined plane. The slump model for the Kalapana earthquake is also more qualitatively consistent with the large horizontal deformation (8 m on land) and tsunami associated with the earthquake, which are difficult to explain with the conventional double-couple source model. The single-force source has been used previously to model the long-period seismic waves from the landslide accompanying the eruption of Mount St. Helens volcano, and may explain other anomalous seismic events as being due to massive slumping of sediments or unconsolidated material and not to elastic dislocation.},

The tsunami was recorded at the Pantoloan tide gauge station with a peak amplitude of 2 m above the water level and struck at high tide. We use the Pantoloan tsunami waveform and synthetic aperture rada displacement data in a joint inversion to estimate the vertical displacement around the narrow bay. Our inversion result suggests that the middle of the bay was uplifted up to 0.8 m, while the other parts of the bay subsided by up to 1 m. However, this seafloor displacement model alone cannot fully explain the observed tsunami inundation. The observed tsunami inundation heights and extents could be reproduced by a tsunami inundation simulation with a source model that combined the estimated vertical displacement with multiple subaerial-submarine landslides.},

These features are not easily understood if the only source of the energy involved is the stored elastic strain.

We detail the real-time solutions that identified the slow-nature of this event, and evaluate how regional reductions in crustal rigidity along the shallow trench as determined by reduced rupture velocity contributed to increased slip, causing the 5--9 m local tsunami runup and observed transoceanic wave heights observed 1600 km to the southeast.},

@article{hill2010MwMentawai2012,
	abstract = {The Mw 7.8 October 2010 Mentawai, Indonesia, earthquake was a ``tsunami earthquake,'' a rare type of earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected based on the seismic magnitude. It produced a locally devastating tsunami, with runup commonly in excess of 6 m. We examine this event using a combination of high-rate GPS data, from instruments located on the nearby islands, and a tsunami field survey. The GPS displacement time series are deficient in high-frequency energy, and show small coseismic displacements ({\textless}22 cm horizontal and {\textless}4 cm subsidence). The field survey shows that maximum tsunami runup was {\textgreater}16 m. Our modeling results show that the combination of the small GPS displacements and large tsunami can only be explained by high fault slip at very shallow depths, far from the islands and close to the oceanic trench. Inelastic uplift of trench sediments likely contributed to the size of the tsunami. Recent results for the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoko-Oki earthquake have also shown shallow fault slip, but the results from our study, which involves a smaller earthquake, provide much stronger constraints on how shallow the rupture can be, with the majority of slip for the Mentawai earthquake occurring at depths of {\textless}6 km. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that the shallow tips of subduction megathrusts are aseismic, and therefore raises important questions both about the mechanical properties of the shallow fault zone and the potential seismic and tsunami hazard of this shallow region.},

	abstract = {In this study, we have evaluated the probabilistic and deterministic seismic hazard for the city of Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan, which has a population of nearly two million people. Almaty is located in the Tien Shan belt, a low-strain-rate environment within the interior of the Eurasian plate that is characterized by large infrequent earthquakes. A robust assessment of seismic hazard for Almaty is challenging because current knowledge about the occurrence of large earthquakes is limited, due to the short duration of the earthquake catalog and only partial information about the geometry, rupture behavior, slip rate, and the maximum expected earthquake magnitude of the faults in the area. The impact that this incomplete knowledge has on assessing seismic hazard in this area can be overcome using both probabilistic and deterministic approaches and integrating the results.},

	abstract = {We determine the slip rate and pattern of interseismic coupling on the Main Himalayan Thrust along the entire Himalayan arc based on a compilation of geodetic, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and microseismicity data. We show that convergence is perpendicular to the arc and increases eastwards from 13.3 $\pm$ 1.7 mm/yr to 21.2 $\pm$ 2.0 mm/yr. These rates are comparable to geological and geomorphic estimates, indicating an essentially elastic geodetic surface strain. The interseismic uplift rate predicted from the coupling model closely mimics the topography, suggesting that a small percentage of the interseismic strain is permanent. We find that the fault is fully locked along its complete length over about 100 km width. We don't find any resolvable aseismic barrier that could affect the seismic segmentation of the arc and limit the along-strike propagation of seismic ruptures. The moment deficit builds up at a rate of 15.1 $\pm$ 1 × 1019 N m/yr for the entire length of the Himalaya.},

	abstract = {The final projected doubling in Earth's population in the next half century, requires an additional 1 billion housing units, more dwellings constructed in a single generation than at any time in Earth's history. Earth's tenfold increase in population has occurred during a time that is short compared to the return time of damaging earthquakes. In the next century, therefore, earthquakes that had little impact on villages and towns, will be shaking urban agglomerations housing upwards of 12 million people. An epicentral hit on a megacity has the potential to cause 1 million fatalities. The incorporation of earthquake resistant structures in the current global building boom, despite successes in the developed nations, has been neglected in the developing nations where historically earthquake damage has been high. The reasons for this neglect are attributed to indifference, ignorance and corrupt practices, not due to an absence of engineering competence. Never has a generation of earthquake engineers been faced with such a grave responsibility to exercise their skills, both political and technical, as now.},

@article{fikeRethinkingAncientSulfur2015,
	abstract = {The sulfur biogeochemical cycle integrates the metabolic activity of multiple microbial pathways (e.g., sulfate reduction, disproportionation, and sulfide oxidation) along with abiotic reactions and geological processes that cycle sulfur through various reservoirs. The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth's exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time δ34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

@article{hsiungXrayFluorescenceCore2021,
	abstract = {The southwestern Ryukyu Trench represents the ultimate sink of sediments shed from Taiwan into the Philippine Sea, which are mainly transported to the trench by turbidity currents via submarine canyons. Here, we present trench turbidites intercalated with hemipelagites in a gravity pilot core and a piston core acquired on the Ryukyu Trench floor at 6147 m water depth. We performed X-ray fluorescence core scans (ITRAX profiles), magnetic measurements, and organic geochemistry analyses to discriminate turbidites from hemipelagites. We identified 36 turbidites (0.9--4.2 cm thick) based on visual core descriptions and Ca/Fe ratios in the ITRAX profiles. Three of these turbidites show magnetic signatures indicating the presence of pyrrhotite and peaks in the magnetic susceptibility profile, suggesting that Taiwan-sourced sediments are transported to the Ryukyu Trench by long-runout turbidity currents. Pyrrhotite is also present in hemipelagites of the upper part of the retrieved cores, indicating a dominant sediment source in Taiwan over the last several thousand years. Ca/Fe and Zr/Rb ratios in the ITRAX profiles mark distal turbidites (about 1--3 cm thick), and Zr/Rb peaks mainly reflect grain size changes. Detailed analyses of a representative turbidite show good correlation between Ca/Fe and Zr/Rb peaks with upward-coarsening and upwardfining trends that delimit the turbidite. Sedimentary organic matter in hemipelagites is characterized by higher total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents and higher δ13C values than that in turbidites. Our multi-proxy approach employing high-resolution XRF core scans to differentiate turbidites from hemipelagites contributes to establishing a comprehensive view of modern trench sedimentation from Taiwan to the southwestern Ryukyu Trench.},

@article{bauchGlacialinterglacialRecordsReflectance1999,
	abstract = {The reflectance of sediments (gray level) were measured on 11 sediment cores from the Norwegian--Greenland--Iceland Sea (Nordic seas). The analyzed time interval covers the past five glacial--interglacial cycles. Although the results demonstrate that the gray-level method has a potential for stratigraphic purposes, it is indicated that gray-level changes in the Nordic seas are not necessarily driven by variations in the content of biogenic calcite. A detailed comparison of gray-level values with contents of total CaCO3 (carbonate) and total organic carbon (TOC) reveals no overall causal link between these proxies. However, specific glacial core sections with layers containing organic-rich sediment clasts as a consequence of iceberg-rafting seem to correlate well with law graylevel values. Of those cores which show relatively high and comparable carbonate values in the last three main interglacial intervals (stages 11, 5.5, and 1), stage 11 is always marked by the highest gray-level values. A close inspection of the surface structure of the foraminiferal tests as well as the conduction of reflectance measurements on these tests leads to the conclusion that enhanced carbonate corrosion occurred during stage 11. The test corrosion not only affected the reflectance of the tests by making them appear whiter, it also seems responsible for the comparatively high gray-level values of the total sediment in stage 11. In contrast, the relatively low gray-level values found in stages 5.5, and 1 are not associated with enhanced test corrosion. This observation implies that variable degrees of carbonate corrosion can have a profound effect on total sediment reflectance.},

@article{macayealBingePurgeOscillations1993,
	abstract = {Ice-rafted debris in sediment cores from the North Atlantic suggests that the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) periodically disgorged icebergs in brief but violent episodes which occurred approximately every 7,000 years. Here, I propose that Heinrich events (i.e., what these episodes are called) were caused by free oscillations in the flow of the Laurentide ice sheet which arose because the floor of Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait is covered with soft, unconsolidated sediment that forms a slippery lubricant when thawed. The proposed Heinrich event cycle has two phases. The growth phase occurs when the sediment is frozen and the LIS is stranded (immobile) on a rigid bed. The volume of the LIS slowly grows during this phase at a rate dictated by snow accumulation. The purge phase occurs when the basal sediment thaws and a basally lubricated discharge pathway (i.e., an ice stream such as those which occur in West Antarctica today) developes through Hudson Strait. The volume of the LIS rapidly equilibrates to the reduced basal friction during this phase by dumping icebergs into the Labrador Sea. The periodicity years of the proposed Heinrich event cycle is a function of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of ice, k and κ, respectively, the atmospheric sea level temperature θsl (in degrees Celsius), and the excess geothermal heat flux defined by where Γ is the atmospheric lapse rate, and G is the geothermal heat flux. Agreement between the predicted T and the apparent periodicity implied by the marine record is the main virtue of the free oscillation mechanism I propose. An alternative mechanism in which Heinrich events are forced by periodic variations in external climate is implausible, because periodic atmospheric temperature perturbations are strongly attenuated with depth in an ice sheet.},

@article{debretSpectrocolorimetricInterpretationSedimentary2011,
	abstract = {Colour is a fundamental property of sediment and is often used for lithographic description to determine sedimentological structures, facies etc. However, the sedimentary information contained in this parameter is difficult to extract because it is difficult to quantify. Colour can be quantified by spectrocolorimetry which provides very high resolution data quickly and non-destructively. When adapted to sedimentology, spectrocolorimeters prove to be powerful tools due to their low purchase and maintenance costs, and some are portable and easily used in-the-field. Several methods have been used to extract sedimentological data from colorimetric spectra (first derivatives, factorial analysis, etc.). In the present study, we first provide a review of the sedimentological application of spectrophotometers and, after having described these methods, their advantages and disadvantages, we then describe a new tool called the Q7/4 diagram (abscissa L*; Ordinates 700/400 ratio). This new technique permits sedimentological units to be defined, allows the identification of different sediment components and provides 5 distinct poles: Clayey deposits, organic rich deposits (chlorophyll a and by products), altered organic matter deposits, iron rich deposits, carbonated deposits. Coupled with the analysis of first derivative spectra, it is possible to distinguish different pigments linked to the degradation and/or nature of the organic material (Chlorophyll a, melanoidin, etc.), the state of iron oxidation (for example, hematite and goethite-like signatures) and the nature of clays. The Q7/4 diagram permits rapid acquisition of high resolution data on changes of sediment dynamics in geosystems that have been subjected to highly varied climatic/environmental conditions. The instrument is non destructive, easy to use and maintain, portable for use in the field, fast to implement, is capable of high resolution, and has a vast range of possible applications. Spectrocolorimetry appears to provide many advantages and could become an essential and robust tool for preliminary sedimentological studies.},

@article{birnerSimilarMillennialClimate2016,
	abstract = {Although millennial-scale climate variability ({\textless}10 ka) has been well studied during the last glacial cycles, little is known about this important aspect of climate in the early Pleistocene, prior to the Middle Pleistocene Transition. Here we present an early Pleistocene climate record at centennial resolution for two representative glacials (marine isotope stages (MIS) 37--41 from approximately 1235 to 1320 ka) during the ``41 ka world'' at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1385 (the ``Shackleton Site'') on the southwest Iberian margin. Millennial-scale climate variability was suppressed during interglacial periods (MIS 37, MIS 39, and MIS 41) and activated during glacial inceptions when benthic δ18O exceeded 3.2‰. Millennial variability during glacials MIS 38 and MIS 40 closely resembled Dansgaard-Oeschger events from the last glacial (MIS 3) in amplitude, shape, and pacing. The phasing of oxygen and carbon isotope variability is consistent with an active oceanic thermal bipolar see-saw between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during most of the prominent stadials. Surface cooling was associated with systematic decreases in benthic carbon isotopes, indicating concomitant changes in the meridional overturning circulation. A comparison to other North Atlantic records of ice rafting during the early Pleistocene suggests that freshwater forcing, as proposed for the late Pleistocene, was involved in triggering or amplifying perturbations of the North Atlantic circulation that elicited a bipolar see-saw response. Our findings support similarities in the operation of the climate system occurring on millennial time scales before and after the Middle Pleistocene Transition despite the increases in global ice volume and duration of the glacial cycles.},

Overflow rates across the ridge are variable (but can be dramatic at times), and may provide a subtle indicator of significant change in the circulation in response to climate change. In spring 2003, a series of CTD sections were conducted during a large overflow event in which Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) cascaded down the southern side of the ridge into the Rockall Trough at a rate of between 1 and 2 Sv. The NSDW was partially mixed with overlying North Atlantic Water (NAW), and comprised about 1/3rd of the cascading water. The components of NAW and NSDW in the overflow were sufficiently large that there must have been a significant divergence of the inflow through the Faroe-Shetland Channel, and of the outflow through the Faroe Bank Channel.},

	abstract = {The overflow of cold water across the Wyville Thomson Ridge transports part of the return flow of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation into the Rockall Trough. It is captured in a narrow westward flowing gully (the Ellett gully) that constrains lateral spreading. The mean total transport (including entrained North Atlantic Water) from several current meter deployments located in the gully since 2003 was between 0.8 and 0.9 Sv, and that of undiluted 0 1C FaroeShetland Channel Bottom Water (FSCBW) 40.2 Sv. A significant part of the overflow appears to be channelled through a newly discovered canyon that leads southward down the southern flank of the Faroe Bank into the Ellett gully. There is a suggestion that the transport has a seasonal signal with larger flows in the summer. The total transport is significantly larger than is sometimes assumed, and the transport of FSCBW into the northeastern North Atlantic is about one-third that of Mediterranean Water into the sub-tropical North Atlantic. The overflow can be expected to have an impact on circulation in the Rockall Trough.},

@article{huberIsotopeCalibratedGreenland2006,
	abstract = {Large temperature variations on millennial time scales in Greenland characterised the last ice age. Abrupt warmings, known as Dansgaard--Oeschger (DO) events, can be traced in the δ18Oice record of Greenland ice cores. However, it has been shown that δ18Oice is not a direct temperature proxy. Measurements of the isotopic composition of gases trapped in the ice can be used to calibrate the paleothermometer. Here we present a continuous temperature record based on high resolution δ15N measurements and firn model studies. It covers a sequence of 9 DO events (9--17) during the time period from 38 to 64 kyr BP for which temperature changes of 8 to 15 $\,^{\circ}$C were estimated. The difference between the modern and the glacial δ18Oice--T relationship can be explained by a combination of source temperature changes and changes in the annual distribution of precipitation. A detailed comparison of the temperature evolution with reconstructions of the atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration shows that CH4 rises lag temperature increases at the onset of DO events by 25 to 70 yr within data resolution. The strong correlation between Greenland temperature and CH4 on millennial and submillennial time scales suggests that variations on these time scales were probably of hemispheric extent. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A chronology was established by correlating millennial-scale features in the benthic d18O record to Portuguese Margin Core MD95-2042. Once the alignment of benthic d18O of JPC-13 to MD95-2042 is fixed, the relative timing of proxy variables is used to determine the phasing of changes in IRD and surface-deep hydrography. Each peak in North Atlantic IRD coincided with a decrease in benthic d18O that, in turn, has been linked to warming in Antarctica (Events A1eA7). The IRD pulses are followed shortly thereafter by abrupt decreases in planktonic d18O, indicating warming and increased heat transport to the subpolar North Atlantic associated with Greenland interstadials (GIS) 8, 12,14, and 16e17. Grain-size and elemental (K/Ti) variations indicate that IcelandeScotland Overflow Water (ISOW) was stronger during these long, warm interstadial periods of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The results are consistent with interhemispheric phase relationships inferred from Iberian Margin sediment cores and with methane synchronization of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores.},

@article{broeckerOriginNorthernAtlantic1992,

He estimated that these layers are spaced at intervals of roughly 10000 years. In this paper we present detailed information documenting the existence of the upper five of these layers in ODP core 609 from 50$\,^{\circ}$N and 24$\,^{\circ}$ W. Their ages are respectively 15000 radiocarbon years, 20000 radiocarbon years, 27000 radiocarbon years, about 40000 years, and about 50000 years. We also note that the high lithic fragment to foram ratio is the result of a near absence of shells in these layers. Although we are not of one mind regarding the origin of these layers, we lean toward an explanation that the Heinrich layers are debris released during the melting of massive influxes of icebergs into the northern Atlantic. These sudden inputs may be the result of surges along the eastern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet.},

@article{petermanPhaseTransformationsContinental2010,
	abstract = {Whether quartzofeldspathic rocks transform to (U)HP minerals during subduction -- and back to low-pressure minerals upon exhumation -- remains one of the more profound questions pertaining to collisional orogenesis. Garnet-bearing quartzofeldspathic gneisses from the Western Gneiss Region, Norway provide an opportunity to answer this question. High-precision Sm-Nd garnet geochronology of these gneisses documents garnet growth from 418 to 398 Ma. Garnet zoning in two samples implies growth during subduction-related increase in pressure from 0.5 GPa and 550  C to 1.7 GPa and 700  C. Zoning in all other garnets suggests growth over rather narrow P--T ranges from 1.0--1.6 GPa and 725--800  C during decompression, possibly accompanying melting. If these samples constitute a representative suite, (i) the dearth of (U)HP garnets suggests that most of the quartzofeldspathic gneisses in the Western Gneiss Region did not transform to eclogite-facies parageneses during subduction; (ii) the abundance of garnets grown during decompression indicates that the major period of densification was during exhumation. The widespread metastability of quartzofeldspathic rocks during subduction is substantially different from the findings of previous work and suggests commensurately less subduction of continental crust before the slab is positively buoyant.},

@article{holbrookTimeRockField2020,
	abstract = {Converging research in modern environments, stratigraphy, numerical modeling, and physical experiments introduce new ideas and reinforce prior thinking on the complex and partial nature of the stratigraphic record. Through different vantages they each ask the question, `what does the rock record actually record?' These studies show the stratigraphic record to be highly incomplete across multiple time scales. They focus new attention on the inverse relationship that was long ago demonstrated by Sadler (1981) between calculated sedimentation rates and the time span of the sections over which the measurements are made. Similarly, these studies note only parts of past processes and events make the final stratigraphic cut. Deep questions about the stratigraphic record remain. Which processes and events preserve? How are these processes and events recorded? What processes govern preferences for preservation of one deposit over another? What is the overall completeness of the stratigraphic recorded? In short, exactly how representative is the stratigraphic record of the geologic past? Despite all these caveats, stratigraphy still appears to preserve a robust record of past time and process. This paper explores current thinking on the sampling processes that build sedimentary deposits, controls on how much and what part of these deposits are preserved, and the interplay between autogenic and allogenic processes over the range of geological time scales. The paper offers a series of guidelines for field geologists attempting to interpret siliciclastic deposits in light of the evolving complex view and limited completeness for the stratigraphic record.},

@article{gantiMorphodynamicHierarchyFabric2020,
	abstract = {The low temporal completeness of fluvial strata could indicate that recorded events represent unusual and extreme conditions. However, field observations suggest that preserved strata predominantly record relatively common transport conditions---a paradox termed the strange ordinariness of fluvial strata. We theorize that the self‐organization of fluvial systems into a morphodynamic hierarchy that spans bed to basin scales facilitates the preservation of ordinary events in fluvial strata. Using a new probabilistic model and existing field and experimental data sets across these scales, we show that fluvial morphodynamic hierarchy enhances the stratigraphic preservation of medial topography---ordinary events. We show that lower‐order landforms have a higher likelihood of complete preservation when the kinematic rates of evolution of successive levels in the morphodynamic hierarchy are comparable. We highlight how relative changes in kinematic rates of evolution of successive levels in the morphodynamic hierarchy can manifest as major shifts in stratigraphic architecture through Earth history. Plain Language Summary Earth's ability to archive its evolution in sedimentary rocks forms the basis of our knowledge of past environments and life. The fraction of time preserved, however, is vanishingly small, which could indicate that preserved strata preferentially record the catastrophic and extreme events of the geologic past. Contrary to this expectation, field evidence across a range of scales suggests that fluvial strata predominantly record the mundane and relatively common transport conditions---a paradox termed the strange ordinariness of fluvial strata. Using a new probabilistic modeling framework and existing experimental and field data, we suggest that the strange ordinariness of fluvial strata is a result of the propensity of rivers to organize themselves into hierarchical elements (e.g., river dunes, bars, channels, and channel belts) that each have their representative timescale of evolution. We show that the presence of this hierarchy reconciles the paradox between the rarity of event preservation and the familiarity of the preserved events in stratigraphy at all scales. We also find that when successive hierarchical elements evolve at comparable rates, ordinary events are more likely to be preserved in stratigraphy. The story written in rocks is thus mostly of the common and mundane, not the rare and spectacular.},

	abstract = {Sadler's (1981) analysis of how measured sedimentation rate decreases with timescale of measurement quantified the vanishingly small fractional time preservation---completeness---of the stratigraphic record. Generalized numerical models have shown that the Sadler effect can be recovered, through the action of erosional clipping and time removal (the ``stratigraphic filter''), from even fairly simple topographic sequences. However, several lines of evidence suggest that most of the missing time has not been eroded out but rather represents periods of inactivity or stasis. Low temporal completeness could also imply that the stratigraphic record is dominated by rare, extreme events, but paleotransport estimates suggest that this is not generally the case: The stratigraphic record is strangely ordinary. It appears that the organization of the topography into a hierarchy of forms also organizes the deposition into concentrated events that tend to preserve relatively ordinary conditions, albeit for very short intervals. Our understanding of time preservation would benefit from insight about how inactivity is recorded in strata; better ways to constrain localized, short-term rates of deposition; and a new focus on integrated time--space dynamics of deposition and preservation.},

Based on thermal gradients, metamorphic rocks are classified into three natural groups: high dT/dP [{\textgreater}775 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa, mean {\textasciitilde}1110 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa (n = 199) rates], intermediate dT/dP [775--375 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa, mean {\textasciitilde}575 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa (n = 127)], and low dT/dP [{\textless}375 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa, mean {\textasciitilde}255 $\,^{\circ}$C/GPa (n = 130)] metamorphism. Plots of T, P, and T/P against age demonstrate the widespread occurrence of two contrasting types of metamorphism---high dT/dP and intermediate dT/dP---in the rock record by the Neoarchean, the widespread occurrence of low dT/dP metamorphism in the rock record by the end of the Neoproterozoic, and a maximum in the thermal gradients for high dT/dP metamorphism during the period 2.3 to 0.85 Ga. These observations falsify the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis that changes in thermal gradients evident in the metamorphic rock record were related to changes in geodynamic regime. Based on the observed secular changes, we postulate that the Earth has evolved through three geodynamic cycles since the Mesoarchean and has just entered a fourth. Cycle I began with the widespread appearance of paired metamorphism in the rock record, which was coeval with the amalgamation of widely dispersed blocks of protocontinental lithosphere into supercratons, and was terminated by the progressive fragmentation of the supercratons into protocontinents during the Siderian--Rhyacian (2.5 to 2.05 Ga). Cycle II commenced with the progressive reamalgamation of these protocontinents into the supercontinent Columbia and extended until the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Tonian (1.0 to 0.72 Ga). Thermal gradients of high dT/dP metamorphism rose around 2.3 Ga leading to a thermal maximum in the mid-Mesoproterozoic, reflecting insulation of the mantle beneath the quasi-integral continental lithosphere of Columbia, prior to the geographical reorganization of Columbia into Rodinia. This cycle coincides with the age span of most anorogenic magmatism on Earth and a scarcity of passive margins in the geological record. Intriguingly, the volume of preserved continental crust of Mesoproterozoic age is low relative to the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras. These features are consistent with a relatively stable association of continental lithosphere between the assembly of Columbia and the breakup of Rodinia. The transition to Cycle III during the Tonian is marked by a steep decline in the thermal gradients of high dT/dP metamorphism to their lowest value and the appearance of low dT/dP metamorphism in the rock record. Again, thermal gradients for high dT/dP metamorphism show a rise to a peak at the end of the Variscides during the formation of Pangea, before another steep decline associated with the breakup of Pangea and the start of a fourth cycle at ca. 0.175 Ga. Although the mechanism by which subduction started and plate boundaries evolved remains uncertain, based on the widespread record of paired metamorphism in the Neoarchean we posit that plate tectonics was established globally during the late Mesoarchean. During the Neoproterozoic there was a change to deep subduction and colder thermal gradients, features characteristic of the modern plate tectonic regime.},

	abstract = {Ultra high pressure (UHP) metamorphism observed in continental terranes implies that continental crust can subduct to {\textasciitilde}40 kbar before exhuming to the surface. This process is one of the least understood and widely debated parts of the orogenic cycle. The dominantly felsic composition of UHP continental terranes means that many petrology-based techniques for determining peak pressures and temperatures are often not possible. In such cases, the detection of UHP conditions depends on the preservation of coesite, a rarely preserved mineral in exhumed UHP terranes as it rapidly transforms to quartz on decompression. Consequently, the qualitative identification of palisade quartz microstructures that form during the retrograde transformation of coesite to quartz is often used to identify UHP terranes. In this study, we conduct electron backscatter diffraction and misorientation analysis of palisade quartz inclusions in the coesite-bearing pyrope quartzite from the Dora Maira massif in the Alps, and matrix-scale palisade quartz in the Polokongka La granite from Tso Morari in the Ladakh Himalaya, in order to quantitatively define crystallographic characteristics of quartz after coesite. The repeatability of our observations in two unrelated occurrences of UHP rocks supports our interpretation that the following features provide a systematic and predictable set of criteria to identify the coesite to quartz transition: (1) Quartz crystallographic orientations define spatially and texturally distinct subdomains of palisade quartz grains with `single crystal' orientations defined by distinct c-axis point maxima. (2) Adjacent subdomains are misorientated with respect to each other by a misorientation angle/axis of 90$\,^{\circ}$/{\textless}a{\textgreater}. (3) Within each subdomain, palisade quartz grain boundaries commonly have intra- and inter-granular misorientations of 60$\,^{\circ}$/[0001], consistent with the dauphin{\'e} twin law. Our observations imply that the coesite-quartz transformation is crystallographically controlled by the epitaxial nucleation of palisade quartz on the former coesite grain, specifically on potential coesite twin planes such as (−101) and (021).},

	abstract = {Phase equilibrium modelling of a conformable sequence of supracristal lithologies from the Bushmanland Subprovince of the Namaqua--Natal Metamorphic Complex (South Africa) reveals a disparity of some 60--70$\,^{\circ}$C in estimated peak metamorphic temperature. Aluminous metapelites were equilibrated at {\textasciitilde}770--790$\,^{\circ}$C, whereas twopyroxene granulite and garnet--orthopyroxene--biotite gneiss record distinctly higher conditions of {\textasciitilde}830--850$\,^{\circ}$C. Semi‐pelite and Mg--Al‐rich gneisses yield poorly constrained estimates that span the range derived from other lithologies. All samples record peak pressure of {\textasciitilde}5--6 kbar, and followed a roughly isobaric heating path from andalusite‐bearing greenschist/lower amphibolite facies conditions through a tight clockwise loop at near‐peak conditions, followed by near‐isobaric cooling. The disparity in peak temperatures appears to be robust, as the low‐variance assemblages in all samples reflect well‐known melting reactions that only occur over narrow temperature intervals. The stable coexistence of both products and reactants of these melting reactions indicates that they did not go to completion before metamorphism waned. Calculated pressure--enthalpy diagrams show that the melting reactions are strongly endothermic and therefore buffer temperature while heat is consumed by melting. Because the respective reactions occur at distinct P--T conditions and have different reactant assemblages, individual lithologies are thermally buffered at different temperatures and to different degrees, depending on the occurrence and abundance of reactant minerals. Our calculations show that all lithologies received essentially the same suprasolidus heat budget of 19 $\pm$ 1 kJ/mol, which led to the manifestation of lower peak temperatures in the more fertile and strongly buffered aluminous metapelites compared with more refractory rock types. If little to no thermal communication is assumed, this implies that lithology exerts a first‐order control over the heating path and the peak temperature that can be attained for a specific heat budget. Our results caution that the metamorphic conditions derived from pelitic granulites should not be assumed or extrapolated to larger sections of an orogenic crust that consist of other, more refractory lithologies.},

@article{tobyStratigraphicFrameworkPreservation2019,
	abstract = {The stratigraphic record contains unique information about past landscapes and environmental change. Whether landscapes faithfully transmit signals of environmental change to stratigraphy is unknown because autogenic processes, such as river avulsion, can obscure signals prior to long‐term stratigraphic storage. We develop a theoretical framework that predicts when a sediment flux signal will be transferred from the landscape to stratigraphy. This threshold magnitude is a function of signal duration. The magnitude is set by the maximum rate of autogenic volume change of the landscape, which decreases with increasing time window. Physical delta experiments, specifically designed to test our theory, demonstrate that only sediment supply signals with a magnitude greater than the threshold are stored in stratigraphy, supporting our theory. This framework allows us to assess the fidelity of the stratigraphic record to archive past signals of environmental change and predict the short‐ and long‐term impact of current anthropogenic forcing on landscapes. Plain Language Summary We generate and validate a theory that predicts by how much sediment supply needs to vary in order to modify a landscape and store that signal in sedimentary deposits accumulating in the landscape. This theory predicts which ancient climatic or tectonic signals we can potentially reconstruct from geological data and whether human activity leaves a trace in the landscape that will be preserved in the geological record.},

@article{marencoBigBeddingPlanes2019,
	abstract = {Roadcuts, core, cliffs and even mountainside exposures often limit the lateral extent to which we can assess bioturbation on bedding planes, simply because exposures of such surfaces are generally rare or small. Such constraints may hamper paleoenvironmental and paleoecological interpretations drawn from facies where most bioturbation is bed-parallel or patchily distributed. To explore how acute such constraints are, we conducted a pilot study of bioturbation in three exceptionally large ({\textgreater} 5 m2), well-exposed, paleoenvironmentally similar bedding planes from the Cambrian of Wisconsin. The goal was to test the hypothesis that trace fossils and biogenic sediment disruption can be distributed heterogeneously at the scale of meters to decameters. Mapping the size variation and distribution of trace fossils across these bedding planes reveals variable patchiness. Individual bioturbated patches tend to be large (m-scale), but the density of biogenic sediment disruption within these patches is quite heterogeneous. In addition, bioturbated areas are separated by zones of undisturbed sediment that vary in size from {\textless} 0.5 m2 to {\textgreater} 3 m2. These observations suggest that ancient bedding planes, like modern substrate surfaces, can exhibit considerable lateral bioturbation heterogeneity at a range of spatial scales. Caution is thus urged when extrapolating the distribution and diversity of trace fossils and other biogenic sedimentary structures across broad sedimentary horizons based on small (≤1 m2) bedding plane exposures.},

Sand and gravel coasts exhibit remarkable resilience to event-driven disturbances, and, in settings where sea level is rising, shorelines retain almost no detailed information about their own past positions. Here, we use a high-frequency, multi-decadal observational record of shoreline position to demonstrate quantitative indications of morphodynamic turbulence -- ``signal shredding'' -- in a sandy beach system. We find that, much as in other dynamic sedimentary systems, processes of sediment transport that affect shoreline position at relatively short timescales may obscure or erase evidence of external forcing. This suggests that the physical effects of annual (or intra-annual) forcing events, including major storms, may convey less about the dynamics of long-term shoreline change -- and vice versa -- than coastal researchers might wish.},

@article{hawkesworthRatesGenerationGrowth2019,
	abstract = {Models for when and how the continental crust was formed are constrained by estimates in the rates of crustal growth. The record of events preserved in the continental crust is heterogeneous in time with distinctive peaks and troughs of ages for igneous crystallisation, metamorphism, continental margins and mineralisation. For the most part these are global signatures, and the peaks of ages tend to be associated with periods of increased reworking of pre-existing crust, reflected in the Hf isotope ratios of zircons and their elevated oxygen isotope ratios. Increased crustal reworking is attributed to periods of crustal thickening associated with compressional tectonics and the development of supercontinents. Magma types similar to those from recent within-plate and subduction related settings appear to have been generated in different areas at broadly similar times before w3.0 Ga. It can be difficult to put the results of such detailed case studies into a more global context, but one approach is to consider when plate tectonics became the dominant mechanism involved in the generation of juvenile continental crust. The development of crustal growth models for the continental crust are discussed, and a number of models based on different data sets indicate that 65\%e70\% of the present volume of the continental crust was generated by 3 Ga. Such estimates may represent minimum values, but since w3 Ga there has been a reduction in the rates of growth of the continental crust. This reduction is linked to an increase in the rates at which continental crust is recycled back into the mantle, and not to a reduction in the rates at which continental crust was generated. Plate tectonics results in both the generation of new crust and its destruction along destructive plate margins. Thus, the reduction in the rate of continental crustal growth at w3 Ga is taken to reflect the period in which plate tectonics became the dominant mechanism by which new continental crust was generated.},

	abstract = {Among the Early Pleistocene fluvial sediments in Japan that yield plant macrofossils, the Uonuma Group in the Niigata sedimentary basin provides the most continuous profile without any conspicuous hiatuses and is therefore suitable for high-resolution reconstructions of environmental and vegetation histories based on tephro- and magneto-stratigraphy. Based on the species composition of plant macrofossil assemblages, along with previously reported results on sedimentary environments and pollen records, we performed a reconstruction of changes in paleovegetation and paleotemperatures between MIS 63 and 53. Macrofossil assemblages identified from 33 samples include 89 arboreal and 88 herbaceous taxa in total, of which 9 taxa are extinct from Japan. Assemblages from the peat deposits in fluvial backmarshes during glacial stages are composed mainly of wetland herbaceous plants, whereas those from the sandy channel-fill deposits are characterized by a higher diversity in life forms and habitat preferences. During the interval from MIS 63 to 53, paleotemperatures fluctuated between a coldest-month mean temperature of {\`A}4.6  C and {\`A}0.9  C and between a mean annual temperature of 6.6  C and 11.0  C, which is within the present range for cool-temperate, deciduous broad-leaved forests in Japan. MIS 60 was the coldest of the glacial stages with temperatures nearly equivalent to those during the last glacial maximum. Major plant extinctions in and around MIS 60 were not recorded in the sedimentary basin in response to the temperature decline. The relatively indistinct floral changes in and around MIS 60 are attributed to easier recovery of flora by migration from glacial refugia in the southern basins after termination of the glacial stage. Interglacial temperatures during MIS 57, 55, and 53 were higher than during MIS 63, 61, and 59. The presence of a maritime environment during the interglacial periods between MIS 57 and 53 may have resulted from a greater extent of marine transgression and heat provided by the Tsushima Warm Current flowing into the Sea of Japan after MIS 59.},

During the Last Glacial Maximum ({\textasciitilde}21,000 years ago), the zonal sea surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Pacific was reduced and productivity was generally lower than modern. To understand the thermocline depth's role in determining the Last Glacial Maximum tropical mean state, we reconstruct the upper ocean δ18O profile from multiple species of planktic foraminifera. We synthesize existing records of surface and subsurface dwelling foraminifera to reconstruct the vertical δ18O gradient throughout the eastern equatorial Pacific. We find the thermocline was deeper during the Last Glacial Maximum than the Holocene throughout the eastern equatorial Pacific region. The thermocline depth's role in the dynamic forcing of the cold tongue contributed to the reduced zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific, decreased productivity, and presumably impacted El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation variability relative to the Holocene. Plain Language Summary The eastern equatorial Pacific is cold and biologically rich because of a shallow thermocline. The thermocline is a subsurface ocean horizon where temperature rapidly decreases with depth. This shallow thermocline in the eastern equatorial Pacific is a key component of the ocean-atmospheric connection that characterizes the tropical Pacific and El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation. But how was the thermocline different in the past? Here we reconstructed the thermocline during the most recent ice age and found the thermocline was deeper than today. This deep thermocline contributed to the overall temperature pattern of the tropical Pacific, decreased the biological productivity and likely influenced the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation.},

@article{liebrandBispectraClimateCycles2019,
	abstract = {The increasingly nonlinear response of the climate--cryosphere system to insolation forcing during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, as recorded in benthic foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O), is marked by a distinct evolution in ice-age cycle frequency, amplitude, phase, and geometry. To date, very few studies have thoroughly investigated the non-sinusoidal shape of these climate cycles, leaving precious information unused to further unravel the complex dynamics of the Earth's system. Here, we present higher-order spectral analyses of the LR04 δ18O stack that describe coupling and energy exchanges among astronomically paced climate cycles. These advanced bispectral computations show how energy is passed from precession-paced to obliquity-paced climate cycles during the Early Pleistocene (from ∼ 2500 to ∼ 750 ka) and ultimately to eccentricity-paced climate cycles during the Middle and Late Pleistocene (from ∼ 750 ka onward). They also show how energy is transferred among many periodicities that have no primary astronomical origin. We hypothesise that the change of obliquity-paced climate cycles during the mid-Pleistocene transition (from ∼ 1200 to ∼ 600 ka), from being a net sink into a net source of energy, is indicative of the passing of a land-ice mass loading threshold in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), after which cycles of crustal depression and rebound started to resonate with the ∼ 110 kyr eccentricity modulation of precession. However, precession-paced climate cycles remain persistent energy providers throughout the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is supportive of a dominant and continuous fuelling of the NH ice ages by insolation in the (sub)tropical zones, and the control it exerts on meridional heat and moisture transport through atmospheric and oceanic circulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A 500,000-yr-long deep-sea sediment-color record from the Northeast Atlantic was investigated to reconstruct the evolution of late Pleistocene climate variability on millennial time scales. Variations of the red--green color intensity are probably caused by climatically induced changes in the ice-rafted input of red-colored iron-bearing terrigenous material to the core site. The resolution of the age model impedes the detection of distinct spectral features at sub-Milankovitch periodicities. Hence, millennial-scale climate variability is quantified as time-dependent variance of the high-pass filtered color time series. The course of the estimated variance shows distinct patterns, which can be linked to continental ice mass. During the past 500,000 yr, large-amplitude millennial-scale climate variability occurs only if continental ice mass exceeds a threshold level, equivalent to sea level at approximately 40\% of the lowering during the last glacial maximum.},

@article{kohlerWhatCausedEarth2010,
	abstract = {The temperature on Earth varied largely in the Pleistocene from cold glacials to interglacials of different warmths. To contribute to an understanding of the underlying causes of these changes we compile various environmental records (and model-based interpretations of some of them) in order to calculate the direct effect of various processes on Earth's radiative budget and, thus, on global annual mean surface temperature over the last 800,000 years. The importance of orbital variations, of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, of the albedo of land ice sheets, annual mean snow cover, sea ice area and vegetation, and of the radiative perturbation of mineral dust in the atmosphere are investigated. Altogether we can explain with these processes a global cooling of 3.9 {\AE} 0.8 K in the equilibrium temperature for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) directly from the radiative budget using only the Planck feedback that parameterises the direct effect on the radiative balance, but neglecting other feedbacks such as water vapour, cloud cover, and lapse rate. The unaccounted feedbacks and related uncertainties would, if taken at present day feedback strengths, decrease the global temperature at the LGM by {\`A}8.0 {\AE} 1.6 K. Increased Antarctic temperatures during the Marine Isotope Stages 5.5, 7.5, 9.3 and 11.3 are in our conceptual approach difficult to explain. If compared with other studies, such as PMIP2, this gives supporting evidence that the feedbacks themselves are not constant, but depend in their strength on the mean climate state. The best estimate and uncertainty for our reconstructed radiative forcing and LGM cooling support a present day equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding the ice sheet and vegetation components) between 1.4 and 5.2 K, with a most likely value near 2.4 K, somewhat smaller than other methods but consistent with the consensus range of 2--4.5 K derived from other lines of evidence. Climate sensitivities above 6 K are difficult to reconcile with Last Glacial Maximum reconstructions.},

@article{huybersGlacialVariabilityLast2007,
	abstract = {An agemodel not relying upon orbital assumptions is estimated over the last 2 Ma using depth in marine sediment cores as a proxy for time. Agemodel uncertainty averages {\AE}10 Ka in the early Pleistocene (\$2--1 Ma) and {\AE}7 Ka in the late Pleistocene (\$1 Ma to the present). Twelve benthic and five planktic d18 O records are pinned to the agemodel and averaged together to provide a record of glacial variability. Major deglaciation features are identified over the last 2 Ma and a remarkable 33 out of 36 occur when Earth's obliquity is anomalously large. During the early Pleistocene deglaciations occur nearly every obliquity cycle giving a 40 Ka timescale, while late Pleistocene deglaciations more often skip one or two obliquity beats, corresponding to 80 or 120 Ka glacial cycles which, on average, give the \$100 Ka variability. This continuous obliquity pacing indicates that the glacial theory can be simplified. An explanation for the \$100 Ka glacial cycles only requires a change in the likelihood of skipping an obliquity cycle, rather than new sources of long-period variability. Furthermore, changes in glacial variability are not marked by any single transition so much as they exhibit a steady progression over the entire Pleistocene. The mean, variance, skewness, and timescale associated with the glacial cycles all exhibit an approximately linear trend over the last 2 Ma. A simple model having an obliquity modulated threshold and only three adjustable parameters is shown to reproduce the trends, timing, and spectral evolution associated with the Pleistocene glacial variability.},

	abstract = {A detailed (ca. 100yr resolution) and well-dated (18 AMS 14C dates to 23 cal. ka BP) record of latest Pleistocene--Holocene variations in terrigenous (eolian) sediment deposition at ODP Site 658C off Cap Blanc, Mauritania documents very abrupt, large-scale changes in subtropical North African climate. The terrigenous record exhibits a well-defined period of low influx between 14.8 and 5.5 cal. ka BP associated with the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was nearly completely vegetated and supported numerous perennial lakes; an arid interval corresponding to the Younger Dryas Chronozone punctuates this humid period. The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value, which was 4.2\% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.},

@article{pierrehumbertClimateNeoproterozoic2011,
	abstract = {The Neoproterozoic is a time of transition between the ancient microbial world and the Phanerozoic, marked by a resumption of extreme carbon isotope fluctuations and glaciation after a billion-year absence. The carbon cycle disruptions are probably accompanied by changes in the stock of oxidants and connect to glaciations via changes in the atmospheric greenhouse gas content. Two of the glaciations reach low latitudes and may have been Snowball events with near-global ice cover. This review deals primarily with the Cryogenian portion of the Neoproterozoic, during which these glaciations occurred. The initiation and deglaciation of Snowball states are discussed in light of a suite of general circulation model simulations designed to facilitate intercomparison between different models. Snow cover and the nature of the frozen surface emerge as key factors governing initiation and deglaciation. The most comprehensive model discussed confirms the possibility of initiating a Snowball event with a plausible reduction of CO2. Deglaciation requires a combination of elevated CO2 and tropical dust accumulation, aided by some cloud warming. The cause of Neoproterozoic biogeochemical turbulence, and its precise connection with Snowball glaciations, remains obscure.},

@article{skinnerAtlanticOceanVentilation2020,
	abstract = {Changes in ocean ventilation, controlled by both overturning rates and air-sea gas exchange, are thought to have played a central role in atmospheric CO2 rise across the last deglaciation. Here we constrain the nature of Atlantic Ocean ventilation changes over the last deglaciation using radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopes from two depth transects in the Atlantic basin. Our findings broadly cohere with the established pattern of deglacial Atlantic overturning change, and underline the existence of active northern sourced deep-water export at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We find that the western Atlantic was less affected by incursions of southern-sourced deep water, as compared to the eastern Atlantic, despite both sides of the basin being strongly influenced by the air-sea equilibration of both northern- and southern deep-water end-members. Ventilation at least as strong as modern is observed throughout the Atlantic during the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d (BA), implying a `flushing' of the entire Atlantic water column that we attribute to the combined effects of AMOC reinvigoration and increased airsea equilibration of southern sourced deep-water. This ventilation `overshoot' may have counteracted a natural atmospheric CO2 decline during interstadial conditions, helping to make the BA a `point of no return' in the deglacial process. While the collected data emphasize a predominantly indirect AMOC contribution to deglacial atmospheric CO2 rise, via far field impacts on convection in the Southern Ocean and/or North Pacific during HS1 and the YD, the potential role of the AMOC in centennial CO2 pulses emerges as an important target for future work.},

@article{hasselmannStochasticClimateModels1976,
	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slowchangesof climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period ``weather'' disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying ``weather'' system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding ``climate'' system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged ``weather'' components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts ``red'' variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

	abstract = {In this paper new and previously published data on the Pleistocene glacial impact on the NW European margin from Ireland to Svalbard (between c. 488N--808N) are compiled. The morphology of the glaciated part of the European margin strongly reflects repeated occurrence of fast-moving ice streams, creating numerous glacial troughs/channels that are separated by shallow bank areas. End-moraines have been identified at several locations on the shelf, suggesting shelf-edge glaciation along the major part of the margin during the Last Glacial Maximum. Deposition of stacked units of glacigenic debris flows on the continental slope form fans at a number of locations from 558N and northwards, whereas the margin to the south of this is characterised by the presence of submarine canyons. Glaciation curves, based primarily on information from the glacial fed fan systems, that depict the Pleistocene trends in extent of glaciations along the margin have been compiled. These curves suggest that extensive shelf glaciations started around Svalbard at 1.6--1.3 Ma, while repeated periods of shelf-edge glaciations on the UK margin started with MIS 12 (c. 0.45 Ma). The available evidence for MIS 2 suggest that shelf-edge glaciation for the whole margin was reached between c. 28 and 22 14C ka BP and maximum positions after this were more limited in some regions (North Sea and Lofoten). The last glacial advance on the margin has been dated to 15--13.5 14C ka BP, and by c. 13 14C ka BP the shelf areas were completely deglaciated. The Younger Dryas (Loch Lomond) advance reached the coastal areas in only a few regions.},

A suite of 350 simulations were designed to explore the parameter space of model uncertainties and sensitivities, to yield a subset of experiments that showed close correspondence to offshore and onshore icedirectional indicators, broad BIIS chronology, and the relative sea-level record. Three of these simulations are described in further detail and indicate that the separate ice centres of the modelled BIIS complex are dynamically interdependent during the build up to maximum conditions, but remain largely independent throughout much of the simulation. The modelled BIIS is extremely dynamic, drained mainly by a number of transient but recurrent ice streams which dynamically switch and fluctuate in extent and intensity on a centennial time-scale. A series of binge/purge, advance/retreat, cycles are identified which correspond to alternating periods of relatively cold-based ice, (associated with a high aspect ratio and net growth), and wet-based ice with a lower aspect ratio, characterised by streaming. The timing and dynamics of these events are determined through a combination of basal thermomechanical switching spatially propagated and amplified through longitudinal coupling, but are modulated and phase-lagged to the oscillations within the NGRIP record of climate forcing. Phases of predominant streaming activity coincide with periods of maximum ice extent and are triggered by abrupt transitions from a cold to relatively warm climate, resulting in major iceberg/melt discharge events into the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The broad chronology of the modelled BIIS indicates a maximum extent at w20 ka, with fastflowing ice across its western and northern sectors that extended to the continental shelf edge. Fastflowing streams also dominate the Irish Sea and North Sea Basin sectors and impinge onto SW England and East Anglia. From w19 ka BP deglaciation is achieved in less than 2000 years, discharging the freshwater equivalent of w2 m global sea-level rise. A much reduced ice sheet centred on Scotland undergoes subsequent retrenchment and a series of advance/retreat cycles into the North Sea Basin from 17 ka onwards, culminating in a sustained Younger Dryas event from 13 to 11.5 ka BP. Modelled ice cover is persistent across the Western and Central Highlands until the last remnant glaciers disappear around 10.5 ka BP.},

	abstract = {During the last glacial the ice sheet that subsumed most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea attained its maximum extent by 27 ka BP and with an ice volume sufficient to raise global sea level by ca 2.5 m when it melted. We reconstruct the demise of this British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and present palaeo-glaciological maps of retreat stages between 27 and 15 ka BP. The whole land area was investigated using remote sensing data and we present maps of moraines, meltwater channels, eskers, and drumlins and a methodology of how to interpret and bring them together. For the continental shelf, numerous large moraines were discovered recording an extensive pattern of retreat stretching from SW Ireland to the Shetland Isles. From an integration of this new mapping of glacial geomorphology ({\textgreater}26,000 landforms) with previously published evidence, compiled in the BRITICE database, we derive a pattern of retreat for the whole BIIS. We review and compile relevant dates (881 examples) that constrain the timing of retreat. All data are held within a Geographic Information System (GIS), and are deciphered to produce a bestestimate of the combined pattern and timing of retreat.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the world's largest current system connecting all three major basins of the global ocean. Our knowledge of glacial-interglacial changes in ACC dynamics in the southeast Pacific is not well constrained and presently only based on reconstructions covering the last glacial cycle. Here we use a combination of mean sortable silt grain size of the terrigenous sediment fraction (10--63 μm, ) and X-ray fluorescence scanner-derived Zr/Rb ratios as flow strength proxies to examine ACC variations at the Pacific entrance to the Drake Passage (DP) in the vicinity of the Subantarctic Front. Our results indicate that at the DP entrance, ACC strength varied by 6--16\% on glacial-interglacial time scales, yielding higher current speeds during interglacial times and reduced current speeds during glacials. We provide evidence that previous observations of a reduction in DP throughflow during the last glacial period are part of a consistent pattern extending for at least the last 1.3 Ma. The orbital-scale cyclicity follows well-known global climate changes from prevailing ca. 41-kyr cycles in the early part of the record (1.3 Ma to 850 ka; marine isotope stage 21) across the mid-Pleistocene transition into the middle and late Pleistocene 100-kyr world. A comparison to a bottom water flow record from the deep western boundary current off New Zealand (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1123) reveals anti-phased changes between the two sites. The enhanced supply of deep water along the DP and into the Atlantic Ocean during interglacials corresponds to a weakened flow of the SW Pacific deep western boundary current.},

@article{robinsonMagneticSusceptibilityVariations1995,
	abstract = {Magnetic susceptibility (MS) variations are used to intercorrelate 17 Upper Pleistocene sediment cores taken from the NE Atlantic, between 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$N. The MS-based correlation depends on regionally consistent patterns of variation in the deposition of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) in response to Pleistocene glaciations, and especially to high-frequency ice-rafting episodes referred to in recent studies as ``Heinrich events.'' The sedimentological and rock-magnetic basis for the apparent relationship between the MS signal and IRD content of NE Atlantic sediments is examined by (1) comparing the MS profiles of selected cores with their records of coarse fraction ({\textgreater} 150 µm) lithic fragment abundance and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin) percentages, and (2) normalizing MS by expressing it both on a carbonate-free basis, and as a quotient with anhysteretic remanent magnetization (a parameter sensitive to magnetic mineral grain size variations). These comparisons show that variations in bulk-sediment MS are only partly driven by simple carbonate dilution ($\pm$ productivity and dissolution) effects. Changes in both the concentration and grain size of magnetic minerals within the lithogenic noncarbonate fraction also impose a significant influence on bulk MS values. In particular, horizons rich in IRD are associated with significant increases in the relative proportion of coarse grained (multidomain) ferrimagnetic particles in the sediment. This is because ice-rafting, in contrast to most other mechanisms capable of transporting detrital magnetic minerals to pelagic environments, has a high potential for delivering large ferrimagnetic grains as components of sand-sized, polycrystalline lithic fragments. This fundamental linkage between the IRD content and MS signal of NE Atlantic sediments is used to reconstruct the patterns of variation in IRD deposition and, by inference, surface currents of the last glacial maximum (LGM, ∼18--19 ka) relative to the present-day NE Atlantic, using the time-slice mapping approach developed by the CLIMAP project group. Our LGM/Holocene MS ratio map, based on sample pairs from over 80 deep-sea cores, confirms that there was a weak, cyclonic gyre north of the polar front in the LGM North Atlantic. The gyre comprised a sluggish warm current in the NE Atlantic flowing north between latitudes 47$\,^{\circ}$ and 62$\,^{\circ}$N, partly fed by subtropical waters from south of the polar front, and carrying large numbers of icebergs derived from several sources, most of which melted between Latitudes 45$\,^{\circ}$ and 52$\,^{\circ}$N. The warm current probably continued its flow into the Iceland Basin, where it fed into a south-flowing current which transported melting icebergs from Iceland and Scandinavia along the western flank of the Reykjanes Ridge.},

@article{sayago-gilMultiProxyApproachIdentifying2019,
	abstract = {A series of six gravity cores has been used to reconstruct the depositional history of Hatton Bank (Rockall Plateau, NE Atlantic Ocean). The cores have been studied for magnetic susceptibility (MS), geochemical composition, grain size distribution, and a semi-quantitative foraminiferal association. Two main interbedded facies have been described: (i) calcareous ooze; and (ii) lithogenous silt. The study reveals prominent peaks from the MS signal, silt, Mg/Ca, Fe/Ca, Al/Ca, and Rare Earth Elements normalised by Continental Crust (REE/CC), which are sensitive indicators for Heinrich events (H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5) and ash layers. These peaks may relate to alternations in dominance of the calcareous and lithogenic facies. The sediment displays a high percentage of carbonate in interglacial layers but is lithogenic-dominated in glacial stages. The layers with prominent lithic-rich and foraminifera-poor sediments (established as Heinrich layers) may be related to a possible palaeoclimatic effect, where freshwater discharged during iceberg melting may have reduced the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). In the study area, the mean sedimentation rates for the last glacial as {\textasciitilde}4.2 cm ka−1 and {\textasciitilde}1.4 cm ka−1 for the last {\textasciitilde}18 ka (interglacial period) have been estimated. Besides this evidence, Fe/Ca and MS peaks may reflect the presence of basalt, either introduced through ice-rafting or transported and redistributed by bottom currents in the study area. Certain indices, including MS and Fe/Ca, are proposed as good proxies for detecting Heinrich events and ash layers in the Hatton Bank sediments and, in consequence, are parameters that can be used to infer strengthened/weakened NADW formation, according to stadials/interstadials. Moreover, we suggest that the northernmost boundary of the area with evidence of Heinrich events may be situated around 57◦38 N in the Hatton--Rockall area, at least for H4, based on the variation of the Mg/Ca and Fe/Ca curves.},

The magnitude of the eruption and the regional wind conditions controlled the extent and concentrations of these ash fallout events.

Ash Zones 1 (x 11,100 yr B.P.), 2 ( x 55,000 yr B.P.) and 3 (x 305,000 yr B.P.) were identified from their major element glass composition. The silicic and alkalic Ash Zones 1 and 2 originate from the Southeastern Volcanic Zone of Iceland, where they correlate with the Sblheimar ignimbrite from Katla volcano and the Th6rsmiirk ignimbrite from Tindfjallajiikull volcano, respectively. The low-alkali composition of silicic Ash Zone 3 indicates a source from one of the silicic centers in the active rift system. Ash Zones 2 and 3 occur in the Irminger Basin as dispersed glass shards over a depth interval of several tens of centimeters. Their compositional and granulometric characteristics reflect an initial fallout on pack-ice north of Iceland, followed by icerafting sedimentation in the Denmark Strait, prior to bioturbation. 6l*O stratigraphy of foraminifera in the cores indicates that the ash zones were deposited during a cold interval, at the time when seas north of Iceland were icecovered. Sedimentary features indicate that turbidity currents were also involved in the dispersal of Ash Zones 1 and 2 south of Iceland. The initiation of these gravity currents from the shelf can be attributed to either glacier bursts (jiikulhlaups) carrying tephra, or the entrance of pyroclastic flows into the ocean.},

@article{mccantaIdentifyingCryptotephraUnits2015,
	abstract = {Understanding the frequency, magnitude, and nature of explosive volcanic eruptions is essential for hazard planning and risk mitigation. Terrestrial stratigraphic tephra records can be patchy and incomplete due to subsequent erosion and burial processes. In contrast, the marine sedimentary record commonly preserves a more complete historical record of volcanic activity as individual events are archived within continually accumulating background sediments. While larger tephra layers are often identifiable by changes in sediment color and/or texture, smaller fallout layers may also be present that are not visible to the naked eye. These cryptotephra are commonly more difficult to identify and often require timeconsuming and destructive point counting, petrography, and microscopy work. Here we present several rapid, nondestructive, and quantitative core scanning methodologies (magnetic susceptibility, visible to shortwave infrared spectroscopy, and XRF core scanning) which, when combined, can be used to identify the presence of increased volcaniclastic components (interpreted to be cryptotephra) in the sedimentary record. We develop a new spectral parameter (BDI1000VIS) that exploits the absorption of the 1 mm nearinfrared band in tephra. Using predetermined mixtures, BDI1000VIS can accurately identify tephra layers in concentrations {\textgreater}15--20\%. When applied to the upper \$270 kyr record of IODP core U1396C from the Caribbean Sea, and verified by traditional point counting, 29 potential cryptotephra layers were identified as originating from eruptions of the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc. Application of these methods in future coring endeavors can be used to minimize the need for physical disaggregation of valuable drill core material and allow for near-real-time recognition of tephra units, both visible and cryptotephra.},

	abstract = {Core MD04-2822 from the Rockall Trough has apparent sedimentation rates of   1 m/kyr during the last deglaciation (Termination I). Component magnetization directions indicate a magnetic excursion at 16.3 m depth in the core, corresponding to an age of 26.5 ka, implying an excursion duration of  350 years. Across Termination I, the mean grain size of sortable silt implies reduced bottom-current velocity in the Younger Dryas and Heinrich Stadial (HS)21A, and increased velocities during the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d warm period. Standard bulk magnetic parameters imply fining of magnetic grain size from the mid-Younger Dryas ( 12 ka) until   8 ka. First-order reversal curves (FORCs) were analyzed using ridge extraction to differentiate single domain (SD) from background (detrital) components. Principal component analysis (FORC-PCA) was then used to discriminate three end members corresponding to SD, pseudo-single domain (PSD), and multidomain (MD) magnetite. The fining of bulk magnetic grain size from 12 to 8 ka is due to reduction in concentration of detrital (PSD 1 MD) magnetite, superimposed on a relatively uniform concentration of SD magnetite produced by magnetotactic bacteria. The decrease in PSD1MD magnetite concentration from 12 to 8 ka is synchronized with increase in benthic d13C, and with major ( 70 m) regional sea-level rise, and may therefore be related to detrital sources on the shelf that had reduced influence as sea level rose, and to bottom-water reorganization as Northern Source Water (NSW) replaced Southern Source Water (SSW).},

@article{feldmannCollapseWestAntarctic2015,
	abstract = {The future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet represents the largest uncertainty in sea-level projections of this and upcoming centuries. Recently, satellite observations and high-resolution simulations have suggested the initiation of an ice-sheet instability in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica, caused by the last decades' enhanced basal ice-shelf melting. Whether this localized destabilization will yield a full discharge of marine ice from West Antarctica, associated with a global sea-level rise of more than 3 m, or whether the ice loss is limited by ice dynamics and topographic features, is unclear. Here we show that in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, a local destabilization causes a complete disintegration of the marine ice in West Antarctica. In our simulations, at 5-km horizontal resolution, the region disequilibrates after 60 y of currently observed melt rates. Thereafter, the marine ice-sheet instability fully unfolds and is not halted by topographic features. In fact, the ice loss in Amundsen Sea sector shifts the catchment's ice divide toward the Filchner--Ronne and Ross ice shelves, which initiates grounding-line retreat there. Our simulations suggest that if a destabilization of Amundsen Sea sector has indeed been initiated, Antarctica will irrevocably contribute at least 3 m to global sea-level rise during the coming centuries to millennia.},

	abstract = {A new atmospheric δ13C record derived from measurements of air trapped in the EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice core, combined with a simple carbon model, provides a high-resolution view of the carbon cycle during the Holocene, the current interglacial period that started about 11,000 years ago. Previous reconstructions had revealed significant changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but the processes responsible for these changes were unclear. The new data suggest that the 5 p.p.m.v. decrease in atmospheric CO2 during the early Holocene resulted from an uptake of about 290 gigatons of carbon by the land biosphere together with carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake at the end of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 during the later Holocene can be mostly explained in terms of carbonate compensation of earlier land biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land biosphere carbon inventory.},

Here we revisit the oldest part of the EDC CO2 record using different air extraction methods and sections of the core. For our established cracker system, we found an analytical artifact, which increases over the deepest 200 m and reaches 10.1 $\pm$ 2.4 ppm in the oldest/deepest part. The governing mechanism is not yet fully understood, but it is related to insufficient gas extraction in combination with ice relaxation during storage and ice structure. The corrected record presented here resolves partly - but not completely - the issue with a different correlation between CO2 and Antarctic temperatures found in this oldest part of the records. In addition, we provide here an update of 800,000 years atmospheric CO2 history including recent studies covering the last glacial cycle.},

	abstract = {The Greenland ice core from NorthGRIP (NGRIP) contains a proxy climate record across the Pleistocene--Holocene boundary of unprecedented clarity and resolution. Analysis of an array of physical and chemical parameters within the ice enables the base of the Holocene, as reflected in the first signs of climatic warming at the end of the Younger Dryas/Greenland Stadial 1 cold phase, to be located with a high degree of precision. This climatic event is most clearly reflected in an abrupt shift in deuterium excess values, accompanied by more gradual changes in d18O, dust concentration, a range of chemical species, and annual layer thickness. A timescale based on multi-parameter annual layer counting provides an age of 11 700 calendar yr b2 k (before AD 2000) for the base of the Holocene, with a maximum counting error of 99 yr. A proposal that an archived core from this unique sequence should constitute the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Holocene Series/Epoch (Quaternary System/Period) has been ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences.

	abstract = {It was thought that the Southern Ocean was relatively free of microplastic contamination; however, recent studies and citizen science projects in the Southern Ocean have reported microplastics in deep-sea sediments and surface waters. Here we reviewed available information on microplastics (including macroplastics as a source of microplastics) in the Southern Ocean. We estimated primary microplastic concentrations from personal care products and laundry, and identified potential sources and routes of transmission into the region. Estimates showed the levels of microplastic pollution released into the region from ships and scientific research stations were likely to be negligible at the scale of the Southern Ocean, but may be significant on a local scale. This was demonstrated by the detection of the first microplastics in shallow benthic sediments close to a number of research stations on King George Island. Furthermore, our predictions of primary microplastic concentrations from local sources were five orders of magnitude lower than levels reported in published sampling surveys (assuming an even dispersal at the ocean surface). Sea surface transfer from lower latitudes may contribute, at an as yet unknown level, to Southern Ocean plastic concentrations. Acknowledging the lack of data describing microplastic origins, concentrations, distribution and impacts in the Southern Ocean, we highlight the urgent need for research, and call for routine, standardised monitoring in the Antarctic marine system.},

Was the warmth of the preindustrial late Holocene natural in origin, the result of orbital changes that had not yet driven the system into a new glacial state? Or was it in considerable degree the result of humans intervening in the climate system through greenhouse gas emissions from early agriculture? Here we summarize new evidence that moves this debate forward by testing both hypotheses. By comparing late Holocene responses to those that occurred during previous interglaciations (in section 2), we assess whether the late Holocene responses look different (and thus anthropogenic) or similar (and thus natural). This comparison reveals anomalous (anthropogenic) signals. In section 3, we review paleoecological and archaeological syntheses that provide ground truth evidence on early anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases. The available data document large early anthropogenic emissions consistent with the anthropogenic ice core anomalies, but more information is needed to constrain their size. A final section compares natural and anthropogenic interpretations of the δ13C trend in ice core CO2.},

@article{cuiSlowReleaseFossil2011,
	abstract = {The transient global warming event known as the Palaeocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum occurred about 55.9 Myr ago. The warming was accompanied by a rapid shift in the isotopic signature of sedimentary carbonates, suggesting that the event was triggered by a massive release of carbon to the ocean--atmosphere system. However, the source, rate of emission and total amount of carbon involved remain poorly constrained. Here we use an expanded marine sedimentary section from Spitsbergen to reconstruct the carbon isotope excursion as recorded in marine organic matter. We find that the total magnitude of the carbon isotope excursion in the ocean--atmosphere system was about 4‰. We then force an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to conform to our isotope record, allowing us to generate a continuous estimate of the rate of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Our simulations show that the peak rate of carbon addition was probably in the range of 0.3--1.7 Pg C yr−1, much slower than the present rate of carbon emissions.},

@article{ruddimanAnthropogenicGreenhouseEra2003,
	abstract = {The anthropogenic era is generally thought to have begun 150 to 200 years ago, when the industrial revolution began producing CO2 and CH4 at rates sufficient to alter their compositions in the atmosphere. A different hypothesis is posed here: anthropogenic emissions of these gases first altered atmospheric concentrations thousands of years ago. This hypothesis is based on three arguments. (1) Cyclic variations in CO2 and CH4 driven by Earth-orbital changes during the last 350,000 years predict decreases throughout the Holocene, but the CO2 trend began an anomalous increase 8000 years ago, and the CH4 trend did so 5000 years ago. (2) Published explanations for these mid- to late-Holocene gas increases based on natural forcing can be rejected based on paleoclimatic evidence. (3) A wide array of archeological, cultural, historical and geologic evidence points to viable explanations tied to anthropogenic changes resulting from early agriculture in Eurasia, including the start of forest clearance by 8000 years ago and of rice irrigation by 5000 years ago. In recent millennia, the estimated warming caused by these early gas emissions reached a global-mean value of ∼0.8 ◦C and roughly 2 ◦C at high latitudes, large enough to have stopped a glaciation of northeastern Canada predicted by two kinds of climatic models. CO2 oscillations of ∼10 ppm in the last 1000 years are too large to be explained by external (solar-volcanic) forcing, but they can be explained by outbreaks of bubonic plague that caused historically documented farm abandonment in western Eurasia. Forest regrowth on abandoned farms sequestered enough carbon to account for the observed CO2 decreases. Plague-driven CO2 changes were also a significant causal factor in temperature changes during the Little Ice Age (1300--1900 AD).},

@article{straubBufferedIncompleteShredded2020,
	abstract = {Climate, tectonics, and life influence the flux and caliber of sediment transported across Earth's surface. These environmental conditions can leave behind imprints in the Earth's sedimentary archive, but signals of climate, tectonic, and biologic change are not always present in the stratigraphic record. Deterministic and stochastic surface dynamics collectively act as a stratigraphic filter, impeding the burial and preservation of environmental signals in sedimentary deposits. Such impediments form a central challenge to accurately reconstructing environmental conditions through Earth's history. Emergent and self‐organized length and timescales in landscapes, which are themselves influenced by regional environmental conditions, define spatial and temporal sedimentation patterns in basins and fundamentally control the likelihood of environmental signal preservation in sedimentary deposits. Properly characterizing these scales provides a key avenue for incorporating the known ``imperfections'' of the stratigraphic record into paleoenvironmental reconstructions. These insights are necessary for answering both basic and applied science questions, including our ability to reconstruct the Earth system response to prior episodes of climate, tectonic, or land cover change. Plain Language Summary Reconstructing the history of Earth prior to the age of scientific instrumentation relies heavily on interpretations of layers of sedimentary rocks, collectively called the stratigraphic record. The composition, architecture, chemistry, and fossils contained in these rocks provide signals of past climate, tectonics, and biology on Earth. However, the storage of these environmental signals in stratigraphy is not straightforward. Environmental signals can be transformed by sediment transport through channels and the landscapes that surround them. This transformation continues as sediment is deposited and strata are formed. In some cases transformation of signals severely hampers paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Recent theoretical developments allow us to model environmental signal propagation through landscapes and to estimate signal distortion or destruction during the burial process. This aids estimation of uncertainties in our paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Further improvements in our ability to quantify these uncertainties will require more detailed descriptions of the statistics and underlying physics of sediment transport and deposition. Improvements in theory, which could aid our ability to predict the statistics of sediment transport and deposition, will need to be tested against laboratory and field observations.},

@article{craigReconcilingGeophysicalPetrological2020,
	abstract = {The thermal structure of the Tibetan plateau---the largest orogenic system on Earth---remains largely unknown. Numerous avenues provide fragmentary pressure/temperature information, both at the present (predominantly informed though geophysical observation) and on the evolution of the thermal structure over the recent past (combining petrological, geochemical, and geophysical observables). However, these individual constraints have proven hard to reconcile with each other. Here, we show that models for the simple underthrusting of India beneath southern Tibet are capable of matching all available constraints on its thermal structure, both at the present day and since the Miocene. Many parameters in such models remain poorly constrained, and we explore the various trade‐offs among the competing influences these parameters may have. However, three consistent features to such models emerge: (i) that present‐day geophysical observations require the presence of relatively cold underthrust Indian lithosphere beneath southern Tibet; (ii) that geochemical constraints require the removal of Indian mantle from beneath southern Tibet at some point during the early Miocene, although the mechanism of this removal, and whether it includes the removal of any crustal material, is not constrained by our models; and (iii) that the combination of the southern extent of Miocene mantle‐derived magmatism and the present‐day geophysical structure and earthquake distribution of southern Tibet require that the time‐averaged rate of underthrusting of India relative to central Tibet since the middle Miocene has been faster than it is at present. Plain Language Summary Numerous proxies for the temperature structure of the lithosphere beneath southern Tibet exist. Geophysical observations provide information about the present‐day structure, geometry, and thermal structure of the area; geodetic and geological observations constrain the regional kinematics over the recent past; geochemical and petrological observations from magmatic rocks within the Himalaya‐Karakorum‐Tibetan plateau provide sparse information about the temperatures beneath southern Tibet over the history of the collision zone. In this paper, we summarize the range of these observations that are presently available and present a series of thermal models aimed at exploring what parameters for the thermal evolution of southern Tibet are capable of explaining all of these observations within a coherent framework. While present‐day observations require the presence of a cold India‐derived lithosphere underthrust beneath southern Tibet, geochemical and petrological data require that this was not present during the early Miocene and was removed prior to this. Further, to fit all observations, our models require that the average rate of underthrusting since the middle Miocene must have been greater than that observed at the present.},

@article{fossenHotColdOrogenic2017,
	abstract = {Observations and modeling show that temperature controls crustal rheology and therefore also the orogenic evolution of continent-continent collision zones and the associated tectonic style. In order to explore the effect of temperature in a natural environment, we compare eroded sections through the unusually cold lower Paleozoic North Atlantic Caledonian (Scandian) collision zone and the very hot Brasiliano/Pan-African Ara{\c c}ua{\'\i}-West Congo orogen. A cold and stiff subducting Caledonian continental margin was able to subduct as a rather coherent unit to ultrahigh-pressure conditions, twice as deep as the Pan-African/Brasiliano crust that was quickly heated and softened and got involved in partial melting. Furthermore, the Caledonian collision developed large coherent thrust sheets that were transported hundreds of kilometers toward the foreland. This was never achieved in the hot Ara{\c c}ua{\'\i}-West Congo orogen, where much of the tectonic stress was absorbed by the partially molten central part of the orogen through magmatic state deformation. Major mylonite zones (thrusts) such as those seen in the Caledonides are therefore less common in the Ara{\c c}ua{\'\i}-West Congo orogen. Further, the deep continental subduction in the Caledonides developed a strongly asymmetric collision zone, with rapid variations in pressure and temperature. In contrast, the Ara{\c c}ua{\'\i}-West Congo orogen soon developed into a more symmetric geometry due to its easily flowing hot crust, with a relatively flat base and a corresponding plateau in its upper part. Deformation of the cold Caledonian crust was controlled by plate-tectonic stress, while gravitational forces more strongly influenced the hot Brasiliano/Pan-African example.},

	abstract = {Controversy surrounds the rheology of the continental lithosphere, and how this rheology controls the evolution and behavior of mountain ranges. In this study, we investigate the effect of lateral contrasts in the strength of the lower crust, such as those between cratonic continental interiors and weaker rocks in the adjacent deforming regions, on the evolution of topography. We combine numerical modeling with recently published results from stable-isotope palaeoaltimetry in south-east Tibet. Stableisotope palaeoaltimetry in this region provides constraints on vertical motions, which are required to distinguish between competing models for lithosphere rheology and deformation. We use numerical modeling to investigate the effect of lateral strength contrasts on the shape and temporal evolution of mountain ranges. In combination with palaeoaltimetry results, our modeling suggests that lateral strength contrasts provide a first-order control on the evolution of topography in south-east Tibet. We find that the evolution of topography in the presence of such strength contrasts leads to laterally varying topographic gradients, and to key features of the GPS- and earthquake-derived strain-rate field, without the need for a low-viscosity, lower-crustal channel. We also find that palaeoaltimetric samples may have been transported laterally for hundreds of kilometers, an effect which should be accounted for in their interpretation. Our results are likely to be applicable to the evolution of mountain ranges in general and provide an explanation for the spatial correlation between cratonic lowland regions and steep mountain range-fronts.},

@article{menegonEarthquakeCycleDry2021,
	abstract = {This paper discusses the results of field-based geological investigations of exhumed rocks exposed in the Musgrave Ranges (Central Australia) and in Nusfjord (Lofoten, Norway) that preserve evidence for lower continental crustal earthquakes with focal depths of approximately 25--40 km. These studies have established that deformation of the dry lower continental crust is characterized by a cyclic interplay between viscous creep (mylonitization) and brittle, seismic slip associated with the formation of pseudotachylytes (a solidified melt produced during seismic slip along a fault in silicate rocks). Seismic slip triggers rheological weakening and a transition to viscous creep, which may be already active during the immediate post-seismic deformation along faults initially characterized by frictional melting and wall-rock damage. The cyclical interplay between seismic slip and viscous creep implies transient oscillations in stress and strain rate, which are preserved in the shear zone microstructure. In both localities, the spatial distribution of pseudotachylytes is consistent with a local (deep) source for the transient high stresses required to generate earthquakes in the lower crust. This deep source is the result of localized stress amplification in dry and strong materials generated at the contacts with ductile shear zones, producing multiple generations of pseudotachylyte over geological time. This implies that both the short- and the long-term rheological evolution of the dry lower crust typical of continental interiors is controlled by earthquake cycle deformation.

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Removal of carbon on geological timescales is generally assumed to be governed by the relative strength of silicate weathering and organic carbon burial. For past transient warming phases organic carbon burial has been considered as a relevant negative feedback, but it remains uncertain how this compares to present-day anthropogenic emissions. The ocean is very effective at organic carbon remineralization and, only certain regions bury significant amounts of organic carbon. Organic carbon burial hotspots include shallow water regions along active continental margins and permanently oxygen-deficient zones.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Shallow inland seas covering continents bear depositional settings with broad low-energy facies and delivery of low-reactivity, fossil (ancient) and terrestrial (both contemporary and aged, i.e., soil) organic carbon and lithogenic particles when they are associated with an active margin. These epicontinental seas might be hydrographically and geographically restricted resulting in oxygen-depleted environments. As such, epicontinental seas might serve as significant carbon sinks for all types of organic carbon components (i.e. marine, fossil, contemporary and aged terrestrial) with a high organic carbon preservation efficiency. However, oxygen deficient environments associated with epicontinental seas are currently rare and, as a consequence, organic carbon burial may be overestimated in importance as a negative feedback to anthropogenic emissions compared to the past.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;As part of the ERC \&amp;\#8220;MAGIC\&amp;\#8221; project, we study the mechanics, relative contribution and preservation efficiency of ancient epicontinental seas as carbon sinks, using organic rich deposits dated to the Paleocene \&amp;\#8211; Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) from the proto-Paratethys and West Siberian seas. We then calculate and compare the amount of organic carbon sequestered in these basins, relative to modeled estimates of global organic carbon burial. Our data corroborates the view that the sequestration of organic carbon arises due to enhanced recycling of phosphorus from sediments under anoxic conditions and coupled increase in biological productivity. We estimate ca. 1380 Gt C burial, plausibly more than half of the estimated global total excess burial across the PETM is focused in the proto-Paratethys and West Siberian seas. This supports the hypothesis that alongside the organic carbon burial on other continental margins, the proto-Paratethys and West Siberian basins acted as significant carbon sinks, leading to the termination of the PETM. An important implication of this is that, for the present-day and other periods in the geological past with small epicontinental seas, the effectiveness of this negative carbon cycle feedback is likely greatly diminished.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

These GMSL estimates are statistically similar to ``backstripped'' estimates from continental margins accounting for compaction, loading, and thermal subsidence. Peak warmth, elevated GMSL, high CO2, and ice-free ``Hothouse'' conditions (56 to 48 Ma) were followed by ``Cool Greenhouse'' (48 to 34 Ma) ice sheets (10 to 30 m changes). Continental-scale ice sheets (``Icehouse'') began {\textasciitilde}34 Ma ({\textgreater}50 m changes), permanent East Antarctic ice sheets at 12.8 Ma, and bipolar glaciation at 2.5 Ma. The largest GMSL fall (27 to 20 ka; {\textasciitilde}130 m) was followed by a {\textgreater}40 mm/yr rise (19 to 10 ka), a slowing (10 to 2 ka), and a stillstand until {\textasciitilde}1900 CE, when rates began to rise. High long-term CO2 caused warm climates and high sea levels, with sea-level variability dominated by periodic Milankovitch cycles.

The balance between floodplain formation and destruction determines the width and pattern of channels. Floodplain structure affects the style and rate of channel avulsion once aggradation takes place. Downstream fining of bed sediment and the sediment balance of fines in the pores of the bed sediment provide the `template' or sediment boundary conditions, from which sorting at smaller scales leads to the formation of distinct channel patterns. Bar patterns provide the template of bank erosion and formation as well as the dynamics of the channel network through bifurcation destabilization. However, so far we have been unable to obtain dynamic meandering in laboratory experiments and in physics-based models that can also produce braiding, which reflects our lack of understanding of what causes the different river patterns.},

Every attempt to measure a rate of accumulation must average together sediment increments and surfaces of hiatus. As the time span of measurement lengthens, longer hiatuses tend to be incorporated into the estimated rate. Consequently, short term rates are systematically faster than longer term rates. As would be expected for a fractal time series, the empirical relationship between accumulation rate and the time span of measurement is a negative power law. Just as a measured length for a coastline is meaningless without a statement of the map scale, a measured rate of sediment accumulation requires a statement of the time scale of measurement. Fractal scaling laws offer a means to estimate and interpret the changes in average accumulation rate from one time scale to another.},

@article{guidoboniLargeEarthquake292004,
	abstract = {On 29 June 1170 a large earthquake hit a vast area in the Near Eastern Mediterranean, comprising the present-day territories of western Syria, central southern Turkey, and Lebanon. Although this was one of the strongest seismic events ever to hit Syria, so far no in-depth or specific studies have been available. Furthermore, the seismological literature (from 1979 until 2000) only elaborated a partial summary of it, mainly based solely on Arabic sources. The major effects area was very partial, making the derived seismic parameters unreliable. This earthquake is in actual fact one of the most highly documented events of the medieval Mediterranean. This is due to both the particular historical period in which it had occurred (between the second and the third Crusades) and the presence of the Latin states in the territory of Syria. Some 50 historical sources, written in eight different languages, have been analyzed: Latin (major contributions), Arabic, Syriac, Armenian, Greek, Hebrew, Vulgar French, and Italian. A critical analysis of this extraordinary body of historical information has allowed us to obtain data on the effects of the earthquake at 29 locations, 16 of which were unknown in the previous scientific literature. As regards the seismic dynamics, this study has set itself the question of whether there was just one or more than one strong earthquake. In the former case, the parameters (Me 7.7 $\pm$ 0.22, epicenter, and fault length 126.2 km) were calculated. Some hypotheses are outlined concerning the seismogenic zones involved.},

@article{hodellTerminalClassicDrought2005,
	abstract = {We present new density records from sediment cores taken along a depth transect in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico. The data reveal in great detail the climatic events that comprised the Terminal Classic Drought (TCD) and coincided with the demise of Classic Maya civilization between ca 750 and 1050 AD. In shallow-water cores, the TCD is marked by a condensed gypsum horizon. In deeper-water sections it is expanded and represented by numerous interbedded gypsum and organic-rich strata. The TCD was not a single, two-century-long megadrought, but rather consisted of a series of dry events separated by intervening periods of relatively moister conditions. We estimate the TCD occurred between ca 770 and 1100 AD and included an early phase (ca 770--870 AD) and late phase (ca 920--1100 AD). The intervening 50-year period (ca 870--920 AD) was relatively moister. Each dry phase is represented by multiple gypsum (density) bands interbedded with organic-rich sediment that indicate alternating dry and wet conditions. Spectral analysis revealed significant periods around 213, 50, and 27 years. Despite uncertainty regarding the ages of these events, their pattern is robust and generally consistent with other proxy records under the same climate regime, such as the marine Cariaco Basin off northern Venezuela (Science 299 (2003) 1731).},

In particular, we highlight a Mid-Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern.},

@article{cuiGlobalWarmingEndPermian2015,
	abstract = {The mass extinction event that occurred at the close of the Permian Period ({\textasciitilde}252 million years ago) represents the most severe biodiversity loss in the ocean of the Phanerozoic. The links between the global carbon cycle, climate change and mass extinction are complex and involve a whole range of often inter-related geochemical, biological, ecologic and climatic factors. It has become widely accepted that the end-Permian mass extinction was associated with a global warming event, because the age of the Siberian Trap eruption, a potentially massive source of carbon dioxide, coincides within error with the extinction event. However, geologic data that are in support of this global warming event are relatively sparse. The chain of events and the causal relationship between the eruption of Siberian Traps and mass extinction is not well established. Global warming, in particular, has only been reported from limited proxy data and climate models, for which the pCO2 in the atmosphere just before and during the end-Permian extinction event is poorly known. This study critically assesses both the proxy climate data and the existing paleoclimate simulations with the goals of assessing our current understanding of the link between mass extinction and climate change and providing some guidance for future studies. Proxies indicate that prior to the end-Permian extinction event tropical sea surface temperatures ranged from {\textasciitilde}22 to 25 $\,^{\circ}$C, and possible pCO2 values ranged from {\textasciitilde}500 to {\textasciitilde}4000 ppm before the extinction event. During the peak extinction, tropical temperatures rose up to {\textasciitilde}30 $\,^{\circ}$C while pCO2 perhaps increased up to {\textasciitilde}8000 ppm. Climate models that use different pre-event pCO2 values show similar amount of CO2 doubling to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursions. We find that the temperature anomaly during the end-Permian extinction is consistent with {\textasciitilde}1.5 doublings of atmospheric pCO2, and that the implied climate sensitivity is 5--6 $\,^{\circ}$C, within the upper range of values produced by climate models.},

	abstract = {Numerous lines of geochemical and stable isotopic evidence indicate that the end-Permian mass extinction was accompanied by abrupt climate change induced by CO2 addition. Catastrophic end-Permian Siberian volcanism may have released a large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere and pushed the Earth's system beyond a critical threshold, causing the mass extinction. However, the injection rate, total amount and source of CO2 are largely unknown. We conducted a suite of simulations using the recently published carbon isotope records and U--Pb ages from Meishan section in Zhejiang province, China. An Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity (cGENIE; http://www.genie.ac.uk) was used to extract the pattern of CO2 release needed to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursion across the Permian-Triassic boundary. This analysis leads us to suggest that the source of CO2 must have been significantly heavier than typical biogenic or thermogenic methane to explain the significant warming that occurred during and after the extinction event. Nevertheless, as with the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum, end-Permian rates of CO2 addition were likely small compared with modern fossilfuel burning, but considerably more protracted, such that the likely total CO2 emitted significantly exceeded the modern fossil-fuel reserves. Peak emission rates corresponded to the onset of the maximum extinction interval, consistent with carbon cycle disruption, including volcanogenic CO2-induced warming (and perhaps ocean acidification), as a trigger for the end-Permian mass extinction.},

	abstract = {The states of past climate
Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold et al. present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.
Science, this issue p. 1383
Much of our understanding of Earth's past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states---Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse---are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.
The response of Earth's climate system to orbital forcing has been highly state dependent over the past 66 million years.

	abstract = {Abstract. The responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other climate variables to an emission pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere are often used to compute the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), to characterize the response timescales of Earth System models, and to build reduced-form models. In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 $\pm$ 9\% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 $\pm$ 12\% and the land the remainder (16 $\pm$ 14\%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 $\pm$ 0.12 $\,^{\circ}$C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95\% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15\% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.},

	abstract = {Earth's penultimate icehouse period, the late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA), was a time of dynamic glaciation and repeated ecosystem perturbation, which was under conditions of substantial variability in atmospheric pCO2 and O2. Improved constraints on the evolution of atmospheric pCO2 and O2/CO2 ratios during the LPIA and its subsequent demise to permanent greenhouse conditions are crucial for better understanding the nature of linkages between atmospheric composition, climate, and ecosystem perturbation during this time. We present a new and age-recalibrated pCO2 reconstruction for a 40 Myr interval (∼ 313 to 273 Ma) of the late Paleozoic that (1) confirms a previously hypothesized strong CO2--glaciation linkage, (2) documents synchroneity between major pCO2 and O2/CO2 changes and compositional turnovers in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, (3) lends support for a modeled progressive decrease in the CO2 threshold for initiation of continental ice sheets during the LPIA, and (4) indicates a likely role of CO2 and O2/CO2 thresholds in floral ecologic turnovers. Modeling of the relative role of CO2 sinks and sources active during the LPIA and its demise on steady-state pCO2 using an intermediate-complexity climate--carbon cycle model (GEOCLIM) and comparison to the new multi-proxy CO2 record provides new insight into the relative influences of the uplift of the Central Pangean Mountains, intensifying aridification, and increasing mafic rock to granite rock ratio of outcropping rocks on the global efficiency of CO2 consumption and secular change in steady-state pCO2 through the late Paleozoic.},

	abstract = {The element oxygen has three stable isotopes: 16O, 17O, and 18O. For a defined process, a change in 18O/16O scales with the corresponding change in 17O/16O, or the fractionation factors 18α and 17α have a relationship of θ = ln17α/ln18α, in which the triple oxygen isotope exponent θ is relatively fixed but does vary with reaction path, temperature, and species involved. When the small variation is of interest, the distinction of three concepts---θ, S (a slope through data points in δ17O--δ18O space), and C (an arbitrary referencing number for the degree of 17O deviation)---becomes important. Triple oxygen isotope variations can be measured by modern instruments and thus offer an additional line of information on the underlying reaction processes and conditions. Analytical methods and Earth science applications have recently been developed for air oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, silicates, oxides, sulfates, carbonates, and phosphates.},

@article{gonfiantiniStableIsotopeFractionations2020,
	abstract = {We performed pan evaporation experiments with the objective of exploring the behaviour of the long-standing Craig--Gordon (C--G) stable isotope model for evaporation under different conditions of air turbulence. The water lost through evaporation was automatically replenished so that a steady isotopic composition was reached, the value of which depended on the isotopic composition of the replenishment water and environmental parameters like temperature, relative humidity and isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapour, and the air turbulence index. The pans were exposed to artificial winds ranging from 0 to 2.5 m/s to change the air turbulence index, which governs the repartition between vapour transported by molecular diffusion and turbulent diffusion. Our data revealed that for wind speeds {\textgreater}0.5 m/s the isotopic composition of the evaporating water deviated from that predicted by the C--G model. This deviation was hypothetically attributed to microdroplets of liquid water removed by the wind without any isotopic fractionation. Isotope mass balance equations allowed us to quantify this water loss, which at wind speeds of \$2 m/s reached 10\% of the total evaporation losses. An alternative kinetic evaporation model was proposed whereby the equilibrium layer and the atmospheric laminar layer above the evaporating water of the C--G model were destroyed by the wind and evaporated water molecules were directly injected into the atmosphere. In this model, the isotopic fractionations were due to the slower kinetics of hydrogen bond breakage between molecules in liquid water when heavy isotopes are involved. Accordingly, our data suggested that for isotope water balance studies where winds are frequently above 2 m/s, the C--G model may be inadequate without appropriate corrections for spray vaporization, or the introduction of appropriate kinetic isotope fractionation factors.},

@article{eilerClumpedisotopeGeochemistryStudy2007,
	abstract = {Clumped isotope geochemistry is concerned with the state of ordering of rare isotopes in natural materials. That is, it examines the extent to which rare isotopes (D, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) bond with or near each other rather than with the sea of light isotopes in which they swim. Abundances of isotopic `clumps' in natural materials are influenced by a wide variety of factors. In most cases, their concentrations approach (within ca. 1\%, relative) the amount expected for a random distribution of isotopes. Deviations from this stochastic distribution result from: enhanced thermodynamic stability of heavy-isotope `clumps'; slower kinetics of reactions requiring the breakage of bonds between heavy isotopes; the mass dependence of diffusive and thermo-gravitational fractionations; mixing between components that differ from one another in bulk isotopic composition; biochemical and photochemical fractionations that may reflect combinations of these simpler physical mechanisms; and, in some cases, other processes we do not yet understand. Although clumped isotope geochemistry is a young field, several seemingly promising applications have already emerged. Most importantly, it appears that proportions of 13C--18O bonds in carbonate minerals are sensitive to their growth temperatures, independent of bulk isotopic composition. Thus, `clumped isotope' analysis of ancient carbonates can be used as a quantitative paleothermometer that requires no assumptions about the δ18O of waters from which carbonates grew. This approach has been used to reconstruct marine temperatures across the Phanerozoic (reaching back to the Silurian), terrestrial ground temperatures across the Cenozoic, thermal histories of aqueously altered meteorites, among other applications. Clumped isotope geochemistry is also placing new constraints on the atmospheric budget and stratospheric photochemistry of CO2, and should be capable of placing analogous new constraints on the budgets of other atmospheric gases. Finally, this field could be extended to encompass sulfates, volatile hydrocarbons, organic moieties and other materials.},

@article{spencerCarbonateClumpedIsotope2015,
	abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry is based upon the principle that the formation temperature of carbonates is proportional to the relative abundance of 13C18O16O in CO2 produced through carbonate acid digestion. Furthermore, the relative abundance of 13C18O16O is independent of the δ18O value of parent water, providing a viable alternative to the classic oxygen isotope carbonate-water paleothermometer. The temperature resolution of this newly developed paleothermometer primarily relies on the analytical techniques required to determine the clumped isotope composition of a carbonate mineral. These analytical techniques involve: (1) CO2 gas evolution, in which carbonate is reacted with phosphoric acid, yielding CO2 with a clumped isotope composition proportional to the carbonate formation temperature; (2) CO2 purification, in which a rigorous purification of acid-liberated CO2 is achieved by removing contaminants; (3) clumped isotope measurement, in which a customized gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer quantifies the raw clumped isotope composition (Δ47) of the purified CO2 gas; and (4) inter-laboratory standardization, in which raw Δ47 values are normalized with respect to a community-accepted reference frame. This review provides an overview and comparison of the analytical techniques currently utilized in stable isotope laboratories for Δ47 measurements, specifically discussing carbonate pre-treatment techniques, phosphoric acid digestion systems, isotope and temperature effects during carbonate phosphoric acid digestion, CO2 purification processes, and the challenges associated with the measurement and standardization of the Δ47 value. Continued refinement of these analytical techniques will aid in reducing sample size, increasing sample throughput, and improving Δ47 external precision and associated paleotemperature resolution. Furthermore, these advances may assist in elucidating the source of discrepancies in slope between two groups of reported carbonate clumped isotope thermometer calibrations.},

@article{siglTimingClimateForcing2015,
	abstract = {Volcanic eruptions contribute to climate variability, but quantifying these contributions has been limited by inconsistencies in the timing of atmospheric volcanic aerosol loading determined from ice cores and subsequent cooling from climate proxies such as tree rings. Here we resolve these inconsistencies and show that large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 2,500 years. Our results are based on new records of atmospheric aerosol loading developed from high-resolution, multi-parameter measurements from an array of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores as well as distinctive age markers to constrain chronologies. Overall, cooling was proportional to the magnitude of volcanic forcing and persisted for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive episodes. Our revised timescale more firmly implicates volcanic eruptions as catalysts in the major sixth-century pandemics, famines, and socioeconomic disruptions in Eurasia and Mesoamerica while allowing multi-millennium quantification of climate response to volcanic forcing.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} {\textless}span id="page1566"/{\textgreater}The last glacial period is characterized by a number of millennial climate events that have been identified in both Greenland and Antarctic ice cores and that are abrupt in Greenland climate records. The mechanisms governing this climate variability remain a puzzle that requires a precise synchronization of ice cores from the two hemispheres to be resolved. Previously, Greenland and Antarctic ice cores have been synchronized primarily via their common records of gas concentrations or isotopes from the trapped air and via cosmogenic isotopes measured on the ice. In this work, we apply ice core volcanic proxies and annual layer counting to identify large volcanic eruptions that have left a signature in both Greenland and Antarctica. Generally, no tephra is associated with those eruptions in the ice cores, so the source of the eruptions cannot be identified. Instead, we identify and match sequences of volcanic eruptions with bipolar distribution of sulfate, i.e. unique patterns of volcanic events separated by the same number of years at the two poles. Using this approach, we pinpoint 82 large bipolar volcanic eruptions throughout the second half of the last glacial period (12--60\&thinsp;ka). This improved ice core synchronization is applied to determine the bipolar phasing of abrupt climate change events at decadal-scale precision. In response to Greenland abrupt climatic transitions, we find a response in the Antarctic water isotope signals ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} and deuterium excess) that is both more immediate and more abrupt than that found with previous gas-based interpolar synchronizations, providing additional support for our volcanic framework. On average, the Antarctic bipolar seesaw climate response lags the midpoint of Greenland abrupt {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} transitions by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}122$\pm$24{\textless}/span{\textgreater} years. The time difference between Antarctic signals in deuterium excess and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, which likewise informs the time needed to propagate the signal as described by the theory of the bipolar seesaw but is less sensitive to synchronization errors, suggests an Antarctic {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} lag behind Greenland of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}152$\pm$37{\textless}/span{\textgreater} years. These estimates are shorter than the 200 years suggested by earlier gas-based synchronizations. As before, we find variations in the timing and duration between the response at different sites and for different events suggesting an interaction of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnection patterns as well as internal climate variability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{wellerRecordModernstylePlate2017,
	abstract = {The Trans-Hudson orogen of North America is a circa 1,800 million year old, middle Palaeoproterozoic continental collisional belt. The orogen may represent an ancient analogue to the Himalayan orogen, which began forming 50 million years ago and remains active today. Both mountain belts exhibit similar length scales of deformation and timescales of magmatism and metamorphism. A notable divergence in this correlation has been the absence of high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic rocks in the Trans-Hudson compared with the Himalaya. It has been debated whether this absence reflects a secular tectonic change, with the requisite cool thermal gradients precluded by warmer ambient mantle temperatures during the Palaeoproterozoic, or a lack of preservation. Here we identify eclogite rocks within the Trans-Hudson orogen. These rocks, which typically form at high pressures and cool temperatures during subduction, fill the gap in the comparative geologic record between the Trans-Hudson and Himalayan orogens. Through the application of phase equilibria modelling and in situ U--Pb monazite dating we show that the pressure--temperature conditions and relative timing of eclogite-facies metamorphism are comparable in both orogenies. The results imply that modern-day plate tectonic processes featuring deep continental subduction occurred at least 1,830 million years ago. This study highlights that the global metamorphic rock record (particularly in older terrains) is skewed by overprinting and erosion.},

	abstract = {230Th-dated oxygen isotope records of stalagmites from Sanbao Cave, China, characterize Asian Monsoon (AM) precipitation through the ends of the third- and fourthmost recent ice ages. As a result, AM records for the past four glacial terminations can now be precisely correlated with those from ice cores and marine sediments, establishing the timing and sequence of major events. In all four cases, observations are consistent with a classic Northern Hemisphere summer insolation intensity trigger for an initial retreat of northern ice sheets. Meltwater and icebergs entering the North Atlantic alter oceanic and atmospheric circulation and associated fluxes of heat and carbon, causing increases in atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperatures that drive the termination in the Southern Hemisphere. Increasing CO2 and summer insolation drive recession of northern ice sheets, with probable positive feedbacks between sea level and CO2.
Variability of the Asian Monsoon over the past 400,000 years correlates with the ends of glacial periods.

@article{hollandCalcificationRateShell2017,
	abstract = {We use LA-ICP-MS depth profiling to explore the sensitivity of shell chemistry of the symbiotic planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa to diurnal changes in the holobiont physiology, over a wide range of seawater pH and DIC compositions. B/Ca and U/Ca vary in concert with diurnal Mg/Ca banding, forming compositional bands that are qualitatively consistent with physiological modification of seawater carbonate chemistry (pH, [B(OH)4−/HCO3−] and [CO32−]) within the foraminiferal microenvironment by the net effects of photosynthesis, respiration and calcification. The amplitude of B/Ca banding broadly conforms to banding predicted using the bulk-shell B/Ca sensitivity to the carbonate chemistry changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment. U/Ca banding tends to be greater than predicted using the published bulk-shell sensitivity of this proxy to carbonate chemistry. This either suggests that carbonate chemistry changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment are greater than predicted by modeling and/or the published bulk shell calibration does not accurately reflect the U/Ca sensitivity at the micro-scale. A fourfold increase in seawater DIC composition (1026 to 4019 μmol kg−1) is associated with significant increases in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca partitioning, and a decrease in Mn/Ca partitioning into shell calcite. The accompanying fourfold increase in calcite saturation produces only a twofold increase in calcification rate (0.14 to 0.28, $\pm$0.02 μm hr−1), suggesting that seawater carbonate chemistry exerts only a small effect on foraminiferal calcification rates, but does have a significant influence on trace element incorporation at both the inter-shell and bulk-shell scale.},

@article{satterthwaiteImplicationsPopulationGrowth2009,
	abstract = {This paper considers the implications of population growth and urbanization for climate change. It emphasizes that it is not the growth in (urban or rural) populations that drives the growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but rather, the growth in consumers and in their levels of consumption. A significant proportion of the world?s urban (and rural) populations have consumption levels that are so low that they contribute little or nothing to such emissions. If the lifetime contribution to GHG emissions of a person added to the world?s population varies by a factor of more than 1,000 depending on the circumstances into which they are born and their life choices, it is misleading to see population growth as the driver of climate change. A review of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels for nations, and how they changed between 1980 and 2005 (and also between 1950 and 1980), shows little association between nations with rapid population growth and nations with high GHG emissions and rapid GHG emissions growth; indeed, it is mostly nations with very low emissions per person (and often only slowly growing emissions) that have had the highest population growth rates. The paper also discusses how in the much-needed planning for global emissions reduction, provision must be made to allow low-income, low-consumption households with GHG emissions per person below the global ?fair share? level to increase their consumption.},

@article{chiefEngagingSouthwesternTribes2016,
	abstract = {Indigenous peoples in North America have a long history of understanding their societies as having an intimate relationship with their physical environments. Their cultures, traditions, and identities are based on the ecosystems and sacred places that shape their world. Their respect for their ancestors and `Mother Earth' speaks of unique value and knowledge systems different than the value and knowledge systems of the dominant United States settler society. The value and knowledge systems of each indigenous and non-indigenous community are different but collide when water resources are endangered. One of the challenges that face indigenous people regarding the management of water relates to their opposition to the commodification of water for availability to select individuals. External researchers seeking to work with indigenous peoples on water research or management must learn how to design research or water management projects that respect indigenous cultural contexts, histories of interactions with settler governments and researchers, and the current socio-economic and political situations in which indigenous peoples are embedded. They should pay particular attention to the process of collaborating on water resource topics and management with and among indigenous communities while integrating Western and indigenous sciences in ways that are beneficial to both knowledge systems. The objectives of this paper are to (1) to provide an overview of the context of current indigenous water management issues, especially for the U.S. federally recognized tribes in the Southwestern United States; (2) to synthesize approaches to engage indigenous persons, communities, and governments on water resources topics and management; and (3) to compare the successes of engaging Southwestern tribes in five examples to highlight some significant activities for collaborating with tribes on water resources research and management. In discussing the engagement approaches of these five selected cases, we considered the four ``simple rules'' of tribal research, which are to ask about ethics, do more listening, follow tribal research protocols, and give back to the community. For the five select cases of collaboration involving Southwestern tribes, the success of external researchers with the tribes involved comprehensive engagement of diverse tribal audience from grassroots level to central tribal government, tribal oversight, on-going dialogue, transparency of data, and reporting back. There is a strong recognition of the importance of engaging tribal participants in water management discussions particularly with pressing impacts of drought, climate change, and mining and defining water rights.},

            The growing energy consumption and associated carbon emission of Bitcoin mining could potentially undermine global sustainable efforts. By investigating carbon emission flows of Bitcoin blockchain operation in China with a simulation-based Bitcoin blockchain carbon emission model, we find that without any policy interventions, the annual energy consumption of the Bitcoin blockchain in China is expected to peak in 2024 at 296.59 Twh and generate 130.50 million metric tons of carbon emission correspondingly. Internationally, this emission output would exceed the total annualized greenhouse gas emission output of the Czech Republic and Qatar. Domestically, it ranks in the top 10 among 182 cities and 42 industrial sectors in China. In this work, we show that moving away from the current punitive carbon tax policy to a site regulation policy which induces changes in the energy consumption structure of the mining activities is more effective in limiting carbon emission of Bitcoin blockchain operation.},

@article{mitrovicaPostglacialGeoidSubsidence1991,
	abstract = {We develop two new spectral formalisms for the gravitationally self-consistent solution of the ``sea level equation'' which governs the redistribution of glacial meltwater on a visco-elastic Earth. The first is a purely spectral technique based on an extension of theory outlined by Dahlen (1976) for determining the equilibrium oceanic tide on an elastic planet. Using this technique, with a feasible spherical harmonic truncation level (ℓ ≤ 30), we can obtain convergence in the computed sea level variations within the degree range ℓ ≤ 10. We also develop a second, ``pseudospectral'' technique, however, which permits the construction of gravitationally self-consistent solutions to much higher degree and order (ℓ ≫ 100). The pseudospectral formalism is employed here to develop a comprehensive physical explanation for the global pattern of present-day sea level variations due to ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment. In particular, we focus upon a mechanism, which we term ``equatorial ocean syphoning,'' that acts to draw water toward the oceanic portion of the collapsing peripheral bulge that encircles previously glaciated regions. The collapse of the forebulge induces a flow of water which is required to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium. The syphoning mechanism dominates the relative sea level (RSL) variation in oceans in the far field of the ice sheets (that is, beyond the peripheral bulge) during periods, such as the interglacial of the past 4000 years, during which the volume of the ice sheets has not (apparently) changed appreciably, while, at the same time, isostatic adjustment persists. The RSL change in the near field is, in contrast, dominated by the (local) vertical displacement of the solid surface. Finally, comparison of gravitationally self-consistent predictions of RSL change in the far field, with the observational data at small Pacific island sites, has provided an upper bound of 1 to 2 m for the eustatic sea level rise produced by any recent (last 3000 years) melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Late Cretaceous?Early Paleogene is the most recent period in Earth history that experienced sustained global greenhouse warmth on multimillion year timescales. Yet, knowledge of ambient climate conditions and the complex interplay between various forcing mechanisms are still poorly constrained. Here we present a 14.75 million-year-long, high-resolution, orbitally tuned record of paired climate change and carbon-cycling for this enigmatic period ({\textasciitilde}67?52 Ma), which we compare to an up-to-date compilation of atmospheric pCO2 records. Our climate and carbon-cycling records, which are the highest resolution stratigraphically complete records to be constructed from a single marine site in the Atlantic Ocean, feature all major transient warming events (termed ?hyperthermals?) known from this time period. We identify eccentricity as the dominant pacemaker of climate and the carbon cycle throughout the Late Maastrichtian to Early Eocene, through the modulation of precession. On average, changes in the carbon cycle lagged changes in climate by {\textasciitilde}23,000 years at the long eccentricity (405,000-year) band, and by {\textasciitilde}3,000?4,500 years at the short eccentricity (100,000-year) band, suggesting that light carbon was released as a positive feedback to warming induced by orbital forcing. Our new record places all known hyperthermals of the Late Maastrichtian?Early Eocene into temporal context with regards to evolving ambient climate of the time.

@article{haydenMultiCenturyImpactsIce2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Past and modern large-scale ice sheet loss results in geographically variable sea level changes. At present, in Hudson Bay, Canada, sea level is decreasing due to glacial isostatic adjustment, which represents a departure from the globally averaged sea level rise. However, there are large uncertainties in future sea level trends with further polar ice sheet retreat in the coming centuries. Sea level changes affect ocean tides considerably because tides are highly sensitive to changes in bathymetry. Here, we present multi-century sea level projections associated with a suite of past and future ice loss scenarios and consider the impact of these changes on ocean tides using an established tidal model. Modern tides in Hudson Bay are poorly resolved due to large uncertainties in bathymetry. To establish an initial condition for our simulations, we constrain bathymetry in the bay using tide observations. Due to gravitational, Earth rotational and deformational effects, Greenland ice loss will produce a small sea level fall in the bay, while Antarctic ice loss will produce a larger than average sea level rise. Our results show that the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change strongly impacts the magnitude and sign of future sea level and tidal amplitude changes in the region, with the largest changes predicted in Hudson Strait and Foxe Basin. We emphasize that further constraints on bathymetry and accurate projections of sea level and tides in Hudson Bay are imperative for assessing the associated impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems.},

The evolution of the coupled model is explored for a suite of simulations in which we vary the bed slope and the forcing that initiates retreat. We find that the sea level fall at the grounding line associated with a retreating ice sheet acts to slow the retreat; in simulations with shallow reversed bed slopes and/or small external forcing, the drop in sea level can be sufficient to halt the retreat. The rate of sea level change at the grounding line has an elastic component due to ongoing changes in ice sheet geometry, and a viscous component due to past ice and ocean load changes.

Our record suggests the wettest period occurred between 10,500 and 6,600 a BP in this region. After this period, the amplitude of Asian summer monsoon decadal-scale variability progressively increased likely in response to increasing ENSO frequency since the middle Holocene. Our study reveals similar asymmetric centennial-scale double-plunging structures of the 8.2, 5.5, and 2.8 ka events in the western Chinese Loess Plateau, suggesting a possible role of solar activity whose impact was amplified around 8.2 ka BP by the meltwater flood. In contrast, the 4.2 ka event exhibit gradually declining monsoon rainfall with centennial- to decadal-scale fluctuations.},

@article{lascuSpeleothemMagnetism2011,
	abstract = {The magnetic recordings preserved in calcite speleothems and the nature of their constituent magnetic minerals hold enormous potential for paleomagnetic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Speleothems lock magnetization in instantly, are not affected by post-depositional effects, and can be dated with high precision. The natural remanence in speleothems is carried mainly by magnetite, and the main remanence acquisition mechanism is depositional, through physical alignment of detrital magnetic grains parallel to the Earth's magnetic field. Detrital particles are deposited on speleothem surfaces either from receding flood waters, or directly from drip water percolating through overlying rock and soil. Chemical remanence, acquired in situ by particles growing through a critical volume, is of secondary importance. Previous studies of speleothem magnetism have shown that geomagnetic features are successfully recorded by speleothems, and can be reproduced at a local and regional scale. Future studies that benefit from increasingly sensitive magnetometers, operating at high spatial resolution, should be able to resolve short-term geomagnetic variability, and characterize events such as geomagnetic excursions at an unprecedented scale. The environmental magnetism of speleothems is still an untapped reservoir, but holds the promise of bridging the gap between mineral-magnetic records from other sedimentary archives and established speleothem environmental proxies (e.g., oxygen and carbon isotopes).},

@article{lachnietClimaticEnvironmentalControls2009,
	abstract = {Variations in speleothem oxygen-isotope values (d18O) result from a complicated interplay of environmental controls and processes in the ocean, atmosphere, soil zone, epikarst, and cave system. As such, the controls on speleothem d18O values are extremely complex. An understanding of the processes that control equilibrium and kinetic fractionation of oxygen isotopes in water and carbonate species is essential for the proper interpretation of speleothem d18O as paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental proxies, and is best complemented by study of site-specific cave processes such as infiltration, flow routing, drip seasonality and saturation state, and cave microclimate, among others. This review is a process-based summary of the multiple controls on d18O in the atmosphere, soil, epikarst, and speleothem calcite, illustrated with case studies. Primary controls of d18O in the atmosphere include temperature and relative humidity through their role in the multiple isotope ``effects''. Variability and modifications of water d18O values in the soil and epikarst zones are dominated by evaporation, mixing, and infiltration of source waters. The isotopically effective recharge into a cave system consists of those waters that participate in precipitation of CaCO3, resulting in calcite deposition rates which may be biased to time periods with optimal dripwater saturation state. Recent modeling, experimental, and observational data yield insight into the significance of kinetic fractionation between dissolved carbonate phases and solid CaCO3, and have implications for the `Hendy' test. To assist interpretation of speleothem d18O time series, quantitative and semi-quantitative d18O-climate calibrations are discussed with an emphasis on some of the difficulties inherent in using modern spatial and temporal isotope gradients to interpret speleothems as paleoclimate proxy records. Finally, several case studies of globally significant speleothem paleoclimate records are discussed that show the utility of d18O to reconstruct past climate changes in regions that have been typically poorly represented in paleoclimate records, such as tropical and subtropical terrestrial locations. The new approach to speleothem paleoclimatology emphasizes climate teleconnections between regions and attribution of forcing mechanisms. Such investigations allow paleoclimatologists to infer regional to global-scale climate dynamics.},

Here we use speleothems -- cave carbonates such as stalagmites and flowstones -- to investigate the utility of in situ dating methodologies for ``challenging'' matrices with typically low U and Pb contents and predominantly late Cenozoic ages. Using samples for which ID data have already been published, we show that accurate ages can be obtained for many speleothem types by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Consideration of our own and literature data suggest that most carbonates with {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&gt;1{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;ppm uranium and a few hundred parts per billion of Pb should be good targets for in situ methodologies, regardless of age. In situ analysis often provides a larger spread in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}U∕Pb{\textless}/span{\textgreater} ratios, which can be advantageous for isochron construction, but isochron ages rarely achieve the ultimate precision of ID analyses conducted on the same samples simply because signal sizes are dramatically reduced. LA analysis is faster than ID and thus will play a significant role in reconnaissance studies. The major advantage of the in situ methodology appears to be the potential for successful dating outcomes in sample types requiring high spatial-resolution analysis or those with a high common-Pb component where LA approaches may facilitate identification of the most radiogenic regions for analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, tropical stalagmite δO18 records have provided valuable insight on glacial and interglacial hydrological variability and its relationship to a variety of natural climate forcings. The transition out of the penultimate glaciation (MIS 6) represents an important target for tropical hydroclimate reconstructions, yet relatively few such reconstructions resolve this transition. Particularly, comparisons between Termination 1 and 2 provide critical insight on the extent and influence of proposed climate mechanisms determined from paleorecords and model experiments spanning the recent deglaciation. Here we present a new compilation of western tropical Pacific hydrology spanning 0--160 ky BP, constructed from eleven different U/Th-dated stalagmite δO18 records from Gunung Mulu National Park in northern Borneo. The reconstruction exhibits significant precessional power in phase with boreal fall insolation strength over the 0--160 ky BP period, identifying precessional insolation forcing as the dominant driver of hydroclimate variability in northern Borneo on orbital timescales. A comparison with a network of paleoclimate records from the circum-Pacific suggests the insolation sensitivity may arise from changes in the Walker circulation system. Distinct millennial-scale increases in stalagmite δO18, indicative of reduced regional convection, occur within glacial terminations and may reflect a response to shifts in inter-hemispheric temperature gradients. Our results imply that hydroclimate in this region is sensitive to external forcing, with a response dominated by large-scale temperature gradients.},

For the Mediterranean and the Near East, this abrupt climate episode radically altered precipitation, with an estimated 30\&thinsp;\%--50\&thinsp;\% drop in rainfall in the eastern basin. While many studies have highlighted similar trends in the northern Mediterranean (from Spain to Turkey and the northern Levant), data from northern Africa and the central-southern Levant are more nuanced, suggesting a weaker imprint of this climate shift on the environment and/or different climate patterns. Here, we critically review environmental reconstructions for the Levant and show that, while the 4.2\&thinsp;ka\&thinsp;BP event also corresponds to a drier period, a different climate pattern emerges in the central-southern Levant, with two arid phases framing a wetter period, suggesting a W-shaped event. This is particularly well expressed by records from the Dead Sea area.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{carolinPreciseTimingAbrupt2019,
	abstract = {The extent to which climate change causes significant societal disruption remains controversial. An important example is the decline of the Akkadian Empire in northern Mesopotamia ∼4.2 ka, for which the existence of a coincident climate event is still uncertain. Here we present an Iranian stalagmite record spanning 5.2 ka to 3.7 ka, dated with 25 U/Th ages that provide an average age uncertainty of 31 y (1σ). We find two periods of increased Mg/Ca, beginning abruptly at 4.51 and 4.26 ka, and lasting 110 and 290 y, respectively. Each of these periods coincides with slower vertical stalagmite growth and a gradual increase in stable oxygen isotope ratios. The periods of high Mg/Ca are explained by periods of increased dust flux sourced from the Mesopotamia region, and the abrupt onset of this dustiness indicates threshold behavior in response to aridity. This interpretation is consistent with existing marine and terrestrial records from the broad region, which also suggest that the later, longer event beginning at 4.26 ka is of greater regional extent and/or amplitude. The chronological precision and high resolution of our record indicates that there is no significant difference, at decadal level, between the start date of the second, larger dust event and the timing of North Mesopotamia settlement abandonment, and furthermore reveals striking similarity between the total duration of the second dust event and settlement abandonment. The Iranian record demonstrates this region's threshold behavior in dust production, and its ability to maintain this climate state for multiple centuries naturally.},

During severe cold (stadial) events in the North Atlantic at ≈88, 77, and 73 ka, stalagmite trace-element data indicate anomalously dry periods at this location. Stadial event increases in the stalagmite oxygen isotopes mirror those in a published Iranian stalagmite 800 km to the west. A global climate model simulates drying across the Middle East region in response to stadial event forcing, in agreement with oxygen isotope enrichments in both Iranian records, caused by a smaller fractional loss of moisture on the trajectory upstream. The paleoproxies and model experiments are consistent in indicating a drier Middle East climate during the cold North Atlantic stadials.},

@article{robertsClimaticVegetationCultural2011,
	abstract = {The eastern Mediterranean region witnessed changes in human culture of the highest importance between {\textasciitilde}9000 and {\textasciitilde}2500 cal. BP (7000--500 bc) and over the same time period was affected by very significant shifts in climate. Stable isotope data from lake and deep-sea sediment cores and from cave speleothems show an overall trend from a wetter to a drier climate during the mid Holocene. Superimposed on this trend were multicentennial oscillations in climate, with notable arid phases occurring around 5300--5000 BP, 4500--3900 BP, and 3100--2800 BP (all ages are expressed in calibrated/ calendar years). T  hese phases coincide with major archaeological transitions across the eastern Mediterranean region (Chalcolithic to early Bronze Age, EBA to MBA, and LBA to Iron Age) implying that environmental stress or opportunity may have acted as a pacemaker for cultural change and reorganisation.  We use 14C and δ13C analysis of archaeobotanical samples from two protohistoric sites in Syria to illustrate the linkage between water availability, climate and cultural change during the third and second millennia bc. Specific societal responses to environmental change were not predictable in advance, but resulted instead from contingent processes involving antecedent conditions, human choice and adaptive strategies. Pollen analysis highlights how changes in climate were coupled to increasing human impacts to transform the region's landscapes. Initial human-induced land-cover transformation commonly took place during Bronze Age times, sometimes coinciding with phases of drier climate, although the pattern and precise timing varied between sites. Changes in climate between the early and late Holocene thus helped to transform eastern Mediterranean landscape ecologies and human cultures, but in complex, non-deterministic ways.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Mediterranean region and the
Levant have returned some of the clearest evidence of a climatically dry
period occurring around 4200 years ago. However, some regional evidence is
controversial and contradictory, and issues remain regarding timing,
progression, and regional articulation of this event. In this paper, we review
the evidence from selected proxies (sea-surface temperature, precipitation,
and temperature reconstructed from pollen, δ18O on
speleothems, and δ18O on lacustrine carbonate) over the
Mediterranean Basin to infer possible regional climate patterns during the
interval between 4.3 and 3.8 ka. The values and limitations of
these proxies are discussed, and their potential for furnishing information
on seasonality is also explored. Despite the chronological uncertainties,
which are the main limitations for disentangling details of the climatic
conditions, the data suggest that winter over the Mediterranean involved drier
conditions, in addition to already dry summers. However, some exceptions to
this prevail -- where wetter conditions seem to have persisted -- suggesting
regional heterogeneity in climate patterns. Temperature data, even if sparse,
also suggest a cooling anomaly, even if this is not uniform. The most common
paradigm to interpret the precipitation regime in the Mediterranean -- a
North Atlantic Oscillation-like pattern -- is not completely satisfactory to
interpret the selected data.},

	abstract = {Variability of sea-surface temperature related to shifts in the mode of the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been implicated as a possible forcing mechanism for the global-scale changes in tropical and subtropical precipitation known as the 4.2 ka event. We review records of coral reef development and paleoceanography from the tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) to evaluate the potential impact of the 4.2 ka event on coral reefs. Our goal is to identify the regional climatic and oceanographic drivers of a 2500-year shutdown of vertical reef accretion in the TEP after 4.2 ka. The 2500-year hiatus represents ∼ 40 \% of the Holocene history of reefs in the TEP and appears to have been tied to increased variability of ENSO. When ENSO variability abated approximately 1.7--1.6 ka, coral populations recovered and vertical accretion of reef framework resumed apace. There is some evidence that the 4.2 ka event suppressed coral growth and reef accretion elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean as well. Although the ultimate causality behind the global 4.2 ka event remains elusive, correlations between shifts in ENSO variability and the impacts of the 4.2 ka event suggest that ENSO could have played a role in climatic changes at that time, at least in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. We outline a framework for testing hypotheses of where and under what conditions ENSO may be expected to have impacted coral reef environments around 4.2 ka. Although most studies of the 4.2 ka event have focused on terrestrial environments, we suggest that understanding the event in marine systems may prove to be the key to deciphering its ultimate cause.},

@article{giescheIndianWinterSummer2019,
	abstract = {Abstract. The plains of northwest South Asia receive rainfall during both the Indian
summer (June--September) and winter (December--March) monsoon. Researchers
have long attempted to deconstruct the influence of these precipitation
regimes in paleoclimate records, in order to better understand regional
climatic drivers and their potential impact on human populations. The
mid--late Holocene transition between 5.3 and 3.3 ka is of particular
interest in this region because it spans the period of the Indus Civilization
from its early development, through its urbanization, and onto eventual
transformation into a rural society. An oxygen isotope record of the
surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from
the northeast Arabian Sea provided evidence for an abrupt decrease in
rainfall and reduction in Indus River discharge at 4.2 ka, which the authors
linked to the decline in the urban phase of the Indus Civilization
(Staubwasser et al., 2003). Given the importance of this study, we used the
same core (63KA) to measure the oxygen isotope profiles of two other
foraminifer species at decadal resolution over the interval from 5.4 to
3.0 ka and to replicate a larger size fraction of G. ruber than
measured previously. By selecting both thermocline-dwelling
(Neogloboquadrina dutertrei) and shallow-dwelling
(Globigerinoides sacculifer) species, we provide enhanced detail of
the climatic changes that occurred over this crucial time interval. We found
evidence for a period of increased surface water mixing, which we suggest was
related to a strengthened winter monsoon with a peak intensity over 200 years
from 4.5 to 4.3 ka. The time of greatest change occurred at 4.1 ka when
both the summer and winter monsoon weakened, resulting in a reduction in
rainfall in the Indus region. The earliest phase of the urban Mature Harappan
period coincided with the period of inferred stronger winter monsoon between
4.5 and 4.3 ka, whereas the end of the urbanized phase occurred some time
after the decrease in both the summer and winter monsoon strength by 4.1 ka.
Our findings provide evidence that the initial growth of large Indus urban
centers coincided with increased winter rainfall, whereas the contraction of
urbanism and change in subsistence strategies followed a reduction in
rainfall of both seasons.},

@article{correiaCarbonNitrogenIsotopic2019,
	abstract = {Rationale Stable isotopic analyses are increasingly used to study the diets of past and present human populations. Yet, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic data of modern human diets collected so far are biased towards Europe and North America. Here, we address this gap by reporting on the dietary isotopic signatures of six tropical African communities: El Molo, Turkana (Kerio), Luhya (Webuye), Luhya (Port Victoria), and Luo (Port Victoria) from Kenya, and Baka from Cameroon; representing four subsistence strategies: fishing, pastoralism, agriculturalism, and hunter-gatherer. Methods We used an elemental analyser coupled in continuous-flow mode to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer to measure the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of hair (n = 134) and nail (n = 80) and the carbon isotopic ratios of breath (n = 184) from these communities, as well as the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of some food samples from the Kenyan communities. Results We expand on the known range of δ13C values in human hair through the hunter-gatherer Baka, with a diet based on C3 plants, and through the agriculturalist Luhya (Webuye), with a diet based on C4 plants. In addition, we found that the consumption of fish from East African lakes is difficult to detect isotopically due to the combined effects of high nitrogen isotopic ratios of plants and the low nitrogen isotopic ratios of fish. Finally, we found that some of the communities studied are markedly changing their diets through increasing sedentism and urbanisation. Conclusions Our findings contribute substantially to the understanding of the environmental, demographic, and economic dynamics that affect the dietary landscape of different tropical populations of Africa. These results highlight the importance of studying a broader sample of human populations and their diet, with a focus on their precise context -- from both isotopic and more general anthropological perspectives.},

	abstract = {Stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) of terrestrial plants are employed across a diverse range of applications in environmental and plant sciences; however, the kind of information that is desired from the δ13C signal often differs. At the extremes, it ranges between purely environmental and purely biological. Here, we review environmental drivers of variation in carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) in terrestrial plants, and the biological processes that can either damp or amplify the response. For C3 plants, where Δ is primarily controlled by the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (ci/ca), coordination between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis and leaf area adjustment tends to constrain the potential environmentally driven range of Δ. For C4 plants, variation in bundle-sheath leakiness to CO2 can either damp or amplify the effects of ci/ca on Δ. For plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), Δ varies over a relatively large range as a function of the proportion of daytime to night-time CO2 fixation. This range can be substantially broadened by environmental effects on Δ when carbon uptake takes place primarily during the day. The effective use of Δ across its full range of applications will require a holistic view of the interplay between environmental control and physiological modulation of the environmental signal.

	abstract = {Isotopic data obtained from human remains can provide information about an individual's origin, migration, and diet. We evaluate the usefulness of carbon, oxygen, strontium, and lead isotopes for forensic investigations by comparing data from Bulgarian teeth with data from other regions. Geo-referencing based on oxygen or strontium isotopes can be misleading due to overlap with other countries in Europe and other continents. Carbon and lead isotopes, in combination with oxygen and strontium isotopes, provide the most useful information for identification of local vs foreigner status. In particular, high-precision Pb isotopes show a distinct ``Bulgarian'' range; however, it is possible that individuals from other countries in Eastern Europe and/or central to western Asia could have overlapping isotopic values. Additional high-precision multi-isotope data from modern humans from different regions in the world are required to transition from speculative to more quantitative estimation of a geographical place of origin for unidentified human remains.},

	abstract = {Recent excavations at Musselburgh, East Lothian (Scotland) revealed twelve skeletons, radiocarbon dated to the Iron Age and Roman period. The high incidence of skeletal trauma characteristic of decapitation in those of Roman date makes this site unusual. A multi-isotope investigation of seven of these individuals was conducted to explore any link between intrusive burial practices and migration at one of Britain's most northerly frontiers. Bulk collagen analysis provided a terrestrial, C3, dietary protein signal (mean δ13C −20.4‰ and δ15N + 11.1‰), consistent with other Romano-British studies. However, the range of δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr and Pb isotopes indicate more diverse origins for the Roman individuals. These results suggest that decapitation burials were afforded to migrants to the Lothian area, but is not indicative of a common origin, implying that something more complex than a shared geographic childhood origin united these individuals. The possible association of these decapitation burials with a nearby 2nd century fort suggests that they may also represent some of the earliest examples of Roman decapitation burials to be found anywhere in Britain.},

@article{fraserRoleStableIsotopes2006,
	abstract = {Recent natural catastrophes with large-scale loss of life have demonstrated the need for a new technique to provide information for disaster victim identification when DNA methods fail to yield the identification of an individual, or in other situations where authorities need to determine the recent geographical life history of people. The latter may be in relation to the identification of individuals detained on suspicion of terrorism or in relation to people-trafficking or smuggling. One proposed solution is the use of stable isotope profiling (SIP) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Exploiting the link between the isotopic signal of dietary components and the isotopic composition of body tissue, the aim of this study was to refine a non-invasive method of analysing human material such as scalp hair and fingernails using SIP and to assess the degree of natural variability in these profiles. Scalp hair and fingernail samples were collected from British and non-British volunteers at Queen's University Belfast every 2 weeks for a minimum of 8 months. Samples were analysed using IRMS to determine their isotopic composition for 13C, 15N, 2H and 18O. The results of this longitudinal study yielded information on the natural variability of the isotopic composition of these tissues. The data demonstrate the relatively low degree of natural variation in the 13C/15N isotopic abundance of scalp hair and fingernails whilst greater variations were recorded in the hydrogen and oxygen values of the same samples. The 15N and 18O values of nail are noticeably more variable than that of scalp hair from the same subject. A hypothesis explaining this trend is put forward based on the faster rate of formation of hair than of nails. This means that there is less time for the compounds forming hair to be affected by biochemical processes that could alter their isotopic signature.},

Median δ15N value was 6.6‰; the 25th and 75th percentile were 5.9‰ and 7.3‰, respectively. Calculated percentages of imported beef were consistent with the δ13C values of purchased Big Macs{\textregistered}. Japanese patties had higher δ13C values than expected based on that country's C3 agriculture, however Japan imports beef from Australia, where C4 plants are prevalent. Lower latitude countries generally had higher δ13C values than higher latitude countries, reflecting the larger distribution of C4 plants in warm regions. Although Big Macs{\textregistered} are a global food, we conclude they also contain local components.},

@article{valenzuelaDietaryHeterogeneityWestern2012,
	abstract = {Although the globalization of food production is often assumed to result in a homogenization of consumption patterns with a convergence towards a Western style diet, the resources used to make global food products may still be locally produced (glocalization). Stable isotope ratios of human hair can quantify the extent to which residents of industrialized nations have converged on a standardized diet or whether there is persistent heterogeneity and glocalization among countries as a result of different dietary patterns and the use of local food products. Here we report isotopic differences among carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotope ratios of human hair collected in thirteen Western European countries and in the USA. European hair samples had significantly lower δ13C values (−22.7 to −18.3‰), and significantly higher δ15N (7.8 to 10.3‰) and δ34S (4.8 to 8.3‰) values than samples from the USA (δ13C: −21.9 to −15.0‰, δ15N: 6.7 to 9.9‰, δ34S: −1.2 to 9.9‰). Within Europe, we detected differences in hair δ13C and δ34S values among countries and covariation of isotope ratios with latitude and longitude. This geographic structuring of isotopic data suggests heterogeneity in the food resources used by citizens of industrialized nations and supports the presence of different dietary patterns within Western Europe despite globalization trends. Here we showed the potential of stable isotope analysis as a population-wide tool for dietary screening, particularly as a complement of dietary surveys, that can provide additional information on assimilated macronutrients and independent verification of data obtained by those self-reporting instruments.},

@article{sageEvolutionC4Photosynthesis2004,
	abstract = {C4 photosynthesis is a series of anatomical and biochemical modifications that concentrate CO2 around the carboxylating enzyme Rubisco, thereby increasing photosynthetic efficiency in conditions promoting high rates of photorespiration. The C4 pathway independently evolved over 45 times in 19 families of angiosperms, and thus represents one of the most convergent of evolutionary phenomena. Most origins of C4 photosynthesis occurred in the dicots, with at least 30 lineages. C4 photosynthesis first arose in grasses, probably during the Oligocene epoch (24--35 million yr ago). The earliest C4 dicots are likely members of the Chenopodiaceae dating back 15--21 million yr; however, most C4 dicot lineages are estimated to have appeared relatively recently, perhaps less than 5 million yr ago. C4 photosynthesis in the dicots originated in arid regions of low latitude, implicating combined effects of heat, drought and/or salinity as important conditions promoting C4 evolution. Low atmospheric CO2 is a significant contributing factor, because it is required for high rates of photorespiration. Consistently, the appearance of C4 plants in the evolutionary record coincides with periods of increasing global aridification and declining atmospheric CO2. Gene duplication followed by neo- and nonfunctionalization are the leading mechanisms for creating C4 genomes, with selection for carbon conservation traits under conditions promoting high photorespiration being the ultimate factor behind the origin of C4 photosynthesis.

@article{nicoliExploringMetamorphicConsequences2018,
	abstract = {Shale and greywacke compositions from the Archean to Phanerozoic record a secular change in the siliciclastic material that comprises much of Earth's continental margins, past and present. This study explores the metamorphic consequence of these compositional changes, by comparing phase equilibrium models constructed for average Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic shale and greywacke compositions equilibrated along two Barrovian-type geotherms: 1330  C/GPa (A) and 800  C/GPa (B). Our models show that Archean siliciclastic rocks can retain up to 4 vol.\% water at middle to lower crustal conditions, nearly twice that of Proterozoic and Phanerozoic compositions. The increased ferromagnesium content of Archean siliciclastic rocks stabilizes chlorite to higher temperatures and results in a biotite-rich assemblage at solidus temperatures. Accordingly, water-absent biotite dehydration melting is predicted to play a greater role in the generation of melt in the metamorphism of Archean aged units, and water-absent muscovite dehydration melting is of increasing importance through the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic. This secular variation in predicted mineral assemblages demonstrates the care with which metamorphic facies diagrams should be applied to Archean compositions. Moreover, secular changes in the composition of shale and greywacke is reflected in the evolution of anatectic melt towards an increasingly less viscous, Ca-rich, and Mg-poor monzogranite.},

Yet quantifying climate's influence on landscapes is a major challenge, not only because it is difficult to know how landscapes responded to past changes in climate, but also because landscapes are shaped by various processes that respond to climate in different ways. I review the current state of efforts to quantify climate's effects on the rates of the main processes that drive landscape evolution, with a focus on unglaciated landscapes formed by bedrock erosion. Although many uncertainties remain, recent research has clarified how the processes governing hillslopes, bedrock channels, and chemical erosion depend on major climate factors such as precipitation and temperature. A few themes emerge, including the importance of climatically mediated biological processes, the role of variability, and the value of natural experiments for revealing climate's effects.},

@article{russellEffectsSeawaterCarbonate2004,
	abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of U/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca to changes in seawater [CO32−] and temperature in calcite produced by the two planktonic foraminifera species, Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides, in laboratory culture experiments. Our results demonstrate that at constant temperature, U/Ca in O. universa decreases by 25 $\pm$ 7\% per 100 μmol [CO32−] kg−1, as seawater [CO32−] increases from 110 to 470 μmol kg−1. Results from G. bulloides suggest a similar relationship, but U/Ca is consistently offset by ∼+40\% at the same environmental [CO32−]. In O. universa, U/Ca is insensitive to temperature between 15$\,^{\circ}$C and 25$\,^{\circ}$C. Applying the O. universa relationship to three U/Ca records from a related species, Globigerinoides sacculifer, we estimate that Caribbean and tropical Atlantic [CO32−] was 110 $\pm$ 70 μmol kg−1 and 80 $\pm$ 40 μmol kg−1 higher, respectively, during the last glacial period relative to the Holocene. This result is consistent with estimates of the glacial--interglacial change in surface water [CO32−] based on both modeling and on boron isotope pH estimates. In settings where the addition of U by diagenetic processes is not a factor, down-core records of foraminiferal U/Ca have potential to provide information about changes in the ocean's carbonate concentration. Below ambient pH (pH {\textless} 8.2), Mg/Ca decreased by 7 $\pm$ 5\% (O. universa) to 16 $\pm$ 6\% (G. bulloides) per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Above ambient pH, the change in Mg/Ca was not significant for either species. This result suggests that Mg/Ca-based paleotemperature estimates for the Quaternary, during which surface-ocean pH has been at or above modern levels, have not been biased by variations in surface-water pH. Sr/Ca increased linearly by 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4\% per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Shell Mg/Ca increased exponentially with temperature in O. universa, where Mg/Ca = 0.85 exp (0.096*T), whereas the change in Sr/Ca with temperature was within the reproducibility of replicate measurements.},

@article{rossCalibrationSrCa2019,
	abstract = {Coral skeletons are the most commonly used high-resolution temperature proxy in the tropical oceans, providing paleoclimate reconstructions dating back centuries to millennia. However, physiological differences in skeletal formation modes together with artifacts arising from coral biomineralization (vital effects) can confound the temperature dependence of single element-to-calcium ratios. In efforts to reduce vital effects and isolate temperature, new approaches have been developed based on Sr-U and Li/Mg, which combine Sr/Ca and U/Ca and Li/Ca and Mg/Ca, respectively. Here we examine the systematics of Sr/Ca, Sr-U, and Li/Mg paleothermometry in 33 colonies of branching (Acropora, Pocillopora, and Stylophora) and foliose (Turbinaria) genera. To address the calibration of these morphologically complex calcifiers, we conducted repeat field trips every 1 to 3 months and collected the most recent ( 1 month) uppermost growth of individual colonies over 18- to 24-month periods. This enables seasonally resolved calibration of genera that exhibit rapid extension and slower secondary calcification. Based on this experimental design, we show that all three proxies capture seasonal to annual temperature variations for their respective growth intervals, providing calibrations across an 11 $\,^{\circ}$C range. Species effects on the temperature dependence were largest for Sr/Ca (22.7\%) yet minor for Li/Mg (7.2\%) and Sr-U (6.3\%). Residuals from proxy-temperature regressions were correlated between Sr/Ca and Li/Mg, indicating similar biological processes may influence Sr/Ca and Li/Mg thermometry. The implications of this study are that Sr-U and to a lesser extent Li/Mg are applicable to fossil branching coral skeletons identified to genus level without the need for modern-day calibration. We further show that all three paleothermometers provide complementary temperature constraints, with Li/Mg and the more species-dependent Sr/Ca showing greater effectiveness at resolving seasonal variability and Sr-U showing greater reliability at capturing mean annual temperature.},

@article{sinclairHighResolutionAnalysis1998,
	abstract = {A method has been developed using laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for rapid high resolution analysis of B, Mg, Sr, Ba, and U in corals. Corals represent a challenge for a microbeam technique due to their compositional and structural heterogeneity, their nonsilicate matrix, and their unusual range of trace element compositions relative to available standards. The method employs an argon-fluoride excimer laser (λ = 193 nm), masked to produce a beam 600 μm wide by 20 μm across to average ablation sampling over a range of structural features. Coral sections are scanned at a constant rate beneath the laser to produce a continuous sampling of the coral surface. Sensitivity drift is controlled by careful preconditioning of the ICP-MS to carbonate material, and standardisation is carried out by bracketing each traverse down the coral sample by analyses of a CaSiO3 glass synthesised from coral powder. The method demonstrates excellent reproducibility of both the shape and magnitude of coralline trace element profiles, with typical precisions of between 1.0 and 3.7\% based on analysis of the synthetic standard. Accuracy varies between 3.8\% for B and 31\% for U. Discrepancies are attributed to heterogeneities in the synthetic standard, and matrix differences between the silicate standard and carbonate sample. The method is demonstrated by analysis of a coral collected from Australia's Great Barrier Reef near a weather station recording in-situ sea-surface-temperature (SST). The elements B, Mg, Sr, and U show seasonal compositional cycles, and tentative calibrations against SST have been derived. Using independent ICP-MS solution estimates of the coral composition to correct for standardisation uncertainties, the following calibrations have been derived: B/Ca (μmol/mol)=1000 ($\pm$20)−20.6 ($\pm$0.8)×SST Mg/Ca (mmol/mol)=0.0 ($\pm$0.3)+0.16 ($\pm$0.01)×SST Sr/Ca (mmol/mol)=10.8 ($\pm$0.1)−0.070 ($\pm$0.004)×SST U/Ca (μmol/mol)=2.24 ($\pm$0.07)−0.046 ($\pm$0.003)×SSTl These calibrations agree with literature within experimental errors, except for Mg which displays a 35\% greater temperature dependence than reported previously. None of the elements in the coral appear to be sensitive to decreases in salinity associated with heavy rainfall in the summer of 1991/1992.},

@article{bryanMgCaTemperature2008,
	abstract = {Over the past decade, the ratio of Mg to Ca in foraminiferal tests has emerged as a valuable paleotemperature proxy. However, large uncertainties remain in the relationships between benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and temperature. Mg/Ca was measured in benthic foraminifera from 31 high-quality multicore tops collected in the Florida Straits, spanning a temperature range of 5.8$\,^{\circ}$ to 18.6$\,^{\circ}$C. New calibrations are presented for Uvigerina peregrina, Planulina ariminensis, Planulina foveolata, and Hoeglundina elegans. The Mg/Ca values and temperature sensitivities vary among species, but all species exhibit a positive correlation that decreases in slope at higher temperatures. The decrease in the sensitivity of Mg/Ca to temperature may potentially be explained by Mg/Ca suppression at high carbonate ion concentrations. It is suggested that a carbonate ion influence on Mg/Ca may be adjusted for by dividing Mg/Ca by Li/Ca. The Mg/Li ratio displays stronger correlations to temperature, with up to 90\% of variance explained, than Mg/Ca alone. These new calibrations are tested on several Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples from the Florida Straits. LGM temperatures reconstructed from Mg/Ca and Mg/Li are generally more scattered than core top measurements and may be contaminated by high-Mg overgrowths. The potential for Mg/Ca and Mg/Li as temperature proxies warrants further testing.},

@article{leaControlsMagnesiumStrontium1999,
	abstract = {Because strontium and magnesium occur in seawater with nearly constant ratios to calcium, variations in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in modern foraminifer shells are due to the influence of environmental parameters on calcification. We have cultured two species of planktonic foraminifera, Globigerina bulloides and Orbulina universa, to establish the influence of temperature, pH, and salinity. Experimental results indicate that temperature is the primary control on shell Mg/Ca and that shell Mg/Ca increases exponentially by about 8 to 10\% per $\,^{\circ}$C. The exponential rise in shell Mg with temperature mirrors the results from inorganic precipitation experiments and suggests at least partial thermodynamic control on Mg incorporation. Both seawater pH and salinity are secondary influences on shell Mg/Ca: −6\% per 0.1 pH unit increase and +4\% per salinity unit increase. Shell Sr/Ca responds far more weakly to environmental parameters, and the small range observed in shell Sr/Ca relative to measurement precision of the ICP-MS method used here limits how well controls on shell Sr can be determined. Higher temperature, salinity, and pH all appear to increase shell Sr/Ca, most likely through the kinetic influence of calcification. Our culturing results demonstrate the potential of Mg/Ca in G. bulloides as a paleothermometer. The culturing results suggest that the standard error of Mg paleothermometry is $\pm$1.1$\,^{\circ}$C, but when the secondary effects of salinity and pH are considered the error increases to $\pm$1.3$\,^{\circ}$C.},

@article{barkerStudyCleaningProcedures2003,
	abstract = {The various cleaning steps required for preparation of foraminiferal samples for Mg/Ca (and Sr/Ca) analysis are evaluated for their relative importance and effects on measured elemental ratios. It is shown that the removal of silicate contamination is the most important step for the measurement of Mg/Ca ratios. In an example, bulk sample Mg/Ca decreases from 10.5 to 2.5 mmol mol−1 during clay removal. Oxidation of organic material causes a lowering of sample Mg/Ca in the order of 10\% or approximately 1$\,^{\circ}$C when converted to temperature. Use of dilute acid leaching to remove adsorbed contaminants causes partial dissolution of the sample carbonate and a corresponding decrease in Mg/Ca. Reductive treatment also causes dissolution of the sample and a decrease in the Mg/Ca ratio of up to 10--15\%. Sample preparation for Sr/Ca analysis does not require the same degree of rigor as is necessary for Mg/Ca work. The ``within-run'' reproducibility of the method described here for G. ruber in a core-top sample from the Arabian Sea was $\pm$1.8\% (mean sample ratio was 4.72 mmol mol−1). When converted to temperature, this becomes 28 $\pm$ 0.2$\,^{\circ}$C. The equivalent result for Sr/Ca was $\pm$0.5\% (mean ratio = 1.44 mmol mol−1).},

@article{tisserandRefiningBenthicForaminiferal2013,
	abstract = {AbstractBenthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca has been shown to have great potential as a proxy for reconstructing deep water temperatures. However, the exact relationship between Mg uptake in benthic foraminifera and temperature is still ambiguous, and further exploration and refinement is much needed to reduce uncertainties associated with the method. Here, we present new core-top Mg/Ca data from benthic foraminiferal species from the lower part of the thermocline in the western tropical Atlantic (northern Brazilian margin). This area is unusual in that the changes in carbonate chemistry along the transect are very small, making it an ideal region for isolating and studying the role of temperature in the incorporation of Mg into the benthic shells. Our results show that benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca largely reflects temperature in this area. Our data are combined with previously published data to produce new and improved Mg/Ca calibration equations for a number of benthic foraminiferal species within the Atlantic Ocean. Our study provides the first C. wuellerstorfi Mg/Ca data for the 4--6$\,^{\circ}$C temperature range and indicates that C. wuellerstorfi Mg/Ca is strongly controlled by temperature. As a result, the newly established C. wuellerstorfi calibration over the entire 0--6$\,^{\circ}$C temperature range is significantly improved with respect to previously published C. wuellerstorfi calibrations limited to the coldest part between 0 and 4$\,^{\circ}$C. Other benthic species (Cibicidoides kullenbergi, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Uvigerina peregrina, and Oridorsalis umbonatus) have also been studied, although these results are less conclusive.},

@article{bransonCoordinationMgForaminiferal2013,
	abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of foraminiferal calcite is a widely accepted and applied empirical proxy for ocean temperature. The analysis of foraminifera preserved in ocean sediments has been instrumental in developing our understanding of global climate, but the mechanisms behind the proxy are largely unknown. Analogies have been drawn to the inorganic precipitation of calcite, where the endothermic substitution of Mg for Ca is favoured at higher temperatures. However, evidence suggests that foraminiferal Mg incorporation may be more complex: foraminiferal magnesium is highly heterogeneous at the sub-micron scale, and high Mg areas coincide with elevated concentrations of organic molecules, Na, S and other trace elements. Fundamentally, the incorporation mode of Mg in foraminifera is unknown. Here we show that Mg is uniformly substituted for Ca within the calcite mineral lattice. The consistency of Mg-specific X-ray spectra gathered from nano-scale regions across the shell (`test') reveals that the coordination of Mg is uniform. The similarity of these spectra to that produced by dolomite shows that Mg is present in an octahedral coordination, ideally substituted for Ca in a calcite crystal structure. This demonstrates that Mg is heterogeneous in concentration, but not in structure. The degree of this uniformity implies the action of a continuous Mg incorporation mechanism, and therefore calcification mechanism, across these compositional bands in foraminifera. This constitutes a fundamental step towards a mechanistic understanding of foraminiferal calcification processes and the incorporation of calcite-bound palaeoenvironment proxies, such as Mg.},

@article{parkerLaurentideIceSheet2022,
	abstract = {Understanding the history of continental ice-sheet growth on North America, and in particular that of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), is important for palaeoclimate and sea-level reconstructions. Information on ice-sheet extent pre-dating the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is heavily reliant, though, on the outputs of numerical models underpinned by scant geological data. Important aspects of LIS history that remain unresolved include the timing of its collapse during Termination 2, the first time that it expanded significantly during the Last Glacial Cycle, and whether its volume was significantly reduced during marine isotope stage (MIS) 3. To address these issues and more, we present authigenic iron-manganese (FeeMn) oxyhydroxide-derived high-resolution records of Pb isotope data and associated rare earth element profiles for samples spanning the past {\textasciitilde}130 kyr from northwest North Atlantic Labrador Sea, IODP Site U1302/3. We use these new data to track chemical weathering intensity and solute flux to the Labrador Sea associated with LIS extent on the adjacent highly radiogenic (high Pb isotope composition) North American Superior Province (SP) craton since the Penultimate Glacial Maximum (PGM). Our new records show that relatively high (radiogenic) values characterise warm marine isotope stages (MIS) 5, 3 and 1 and the lowest (most unradiogenic) values occurred during cold stages MIS 6, 4 and 2. The radiogenic Pb isotope excursion associated with Termination 2 is short-lived relative to the one documented for Termination 1, suggesting that LIS retreat during the PGM was relatively fast compared to the LGM and that its collapse during the last interglacial occurred {\textasciitilde}125 ka. Highly radiogenic inputs to the Labrador Sea during MIS 5d-a, {\textasciitilde}116e71 ka, most likely reflect a spin-up in Labrador Current vigour, incipient glaciation and renewed glacial erosion of high grounds of the eastern SP craton by localised wet-based ice-caps. A large decrease in Pb isotope values towards unradiogenic LGM-like compositions between {\textasciitilde}75e65 ka across the MIS 5/4 transition likely reflects a slow-down in Labrador Current vigour, an increase in subaerial deposition of aeolian dust and a significant advance of the LIS across Hudson Bay caused a strong reduction or even abandonment of Pb sourcing from the SP. The relatively radiogenic Pb isotope composition of bottom-waters bathing our study site during MIS 3, 57e29 ka, is unlikely to support a recently proposed major reduction in LIS extent for this time. Instead, we argue these values are better explained by southern Greenland Ice Sheet retreat, increased chemical weathering of the Ketelidian Mobile Belt and subsequent Pb runoff from Greenland.},

	abstract = {Paired measurements of magnesium-to-calcium ratios (Mg/Ca) and the stable oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O) in foraminifera have significantly advanced our knowledge of the climate system by providing information on past temperature and seawater δ18O (δ18Osw, a proxy for salinity and ice volume). However, multiple sources of uncertainty exist in transferring these downcore geochemical data into quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions. Here we develop a computational toolkit entitled Paleo-Seawater Uncertainty Solver (PSU Solver) that performs bootstrap Monte Carlo simulations to constrain these various sources of uncertainty. PSU Solver calculates temperature and δ18Osw, and their respective confidence intervals using an iterative approach with user-defined errors, calibrations, and sea-level curves. Our probabilistic approach yields reduced uncertainty constraints compared to theoretical considerations and commonly used propagation exercises. We demonstrate the applicability of PSU Solver for published records covering three timescales: the late Holocene, the last deglaciation, and the last glacial period. We show that the influence of salinity on Mg/Ca can considerably alter the structure and amplitude of change in the resulting reconstruction and can impact the interpretation of paleoceanographic time series. We also highlight the sensitivity of the records to various inputs of sea-level curves, transfer functions, and uncertainty constraints. PSU Solver offers an expeditious yet rigorous approach to test the robustness of past climate variability inferred from paired Mg/Ca-δ18O measurements.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity to temperature of Mg/Ca ratios in the shallow-infaunal benthic foraminifera Uvigerina spp. has been assessed. Core-top calibrations over w1--20  C show a range in sensitivity of 0.065--0.084 mmol/mol/ C but few data are available spanning the temperature range anticipated in deep-sea records over glacial--interglacial cycles. In contrast to epibenthic foraminiferal species, carbonate ion saturation appears not to affect Mg/Ca significantly. A method based on estimating the ratio of the temperature sensitivity of foraminiferal Mg/Ca to that of d18Ocalcite shows that sensitivity for Mg/Ca at the high end of the observed core-top range (w0.1 mmol/mol/ C) is required for consistency with LGM--Holocene differences in each property as constrained by independent proxy data. This is supported by a Mg/Ca record for Uvigerina spp. generated for the Southern Ocean over the past 440,000 years from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1123 (Chatham Rise, New Zealand). The record shows variability that correlates with climate oscillations. The LGM deep ocean temperature derived from the Mg/Ca record is {\`A}1.1 {\AE} 0.3  C. Transformation to temperature allows estimates to be made of changes in bottom water temperature and seawater d18O and comparison made with literature records. Analysis reveals a w2.5kyr lead in the record of temperature over calcite d18O and a longer lead over seawater d18O. This is a reflection of larger phase offsets at eccentricity periods; phase offsets at tilt and precession are within error zero.},

@article{fordGradualAbruptChanges2016,
	abstract = {During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), the dominant glacial-interglacial cyclicity as inferred from the marine d18O records of benthic foraminifera (d18Obenthic) changed from 41 kyr to 100 kyr years in the absence of a comparable change in orbital forcing. Currently, only two Mg/Ca-derived, high-resolution bottom water temperature (BWT) records exist that can be used with d18Obenthic records to separate temperature and ice volume signals over the Pleistocene. However, these two BWT records suggest a different pattern of climate change occurred over the MPTda record from North Atlantic DSDP Site 607 suggests BWT decreased with no long-term trend in ice volume over the MPT, while South Pacific ODP Site 1123 suggests that BWT has been relatively stable over the last 1.5 Myr but that there was an abrupt increase in ice volume at {\textasciitilde}900 kyr. In this paper we attempt to reconcile these two views of climate change across the MPT. Specifically, we investigated the suggestion that the secular BWT trend obtained from Mg/Ca measurements on Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Oridorsalis umbonatus species from N. Atlantic Site 607 is biased by the possible influence of D[CO32{\`A}] on Mg/Ca values in these species by generating a low-resolution BWT record using Uvigerina spp., a genus whose Mg/Ca values are not thought to be influenced by D[CO32{\`A}]. We find a long-term BWT cooling of {\textasciitilde}2e3 C occurred from 1500 to {\textasciitilde}500 kyr in the N. Atlantic, consistent with the previously generated C. wuellerstorfi and O. umbonatus BWT record. We also find that changes in ocean circulation likely influenced d18Obenthic, BWT, and d18Oseawater records across the MPT. N. Atlantic BWT cooling starting at {\textasciitilde}1.2 Ma, presumably driven by high-latitude cooling, may have been a necessary precursor to a threshold response in climate-ice sheet behavior at {\textasciitilde}900 ka. At that point, a modest increase in ice volume and thermohaline reorganization may have caused enhanced sensitivity to the 100 kyr orbital cycle.},

@article{fehrenbacherComparisonLaserAblation2020,
	abstract = {The trace element and isotopic composition of foraminifera shells are widely used in paleoceanography to reconstruct past ocean conditions. Individual foraminifer analysis (IFA) is a rapidly expanding technique for obtaining trace element and/or isotope data from individual foraminifer specimens. IFA permits an assessment of population variability, which can be linked to environmental conditions at the time of calcification or can be used to assess postdepositional diagenesis. Uniform interpretation of IFA depends on the assumption that the data are not impacted by analytical technique. Here, we compare paired trace element (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) data for the same specimens analyzed first using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), followed by solution ICP-MS. Foraminiferal trace element (TE) to calcium ratios compare well between the two methods for foraminifera of simple morphology (Orbulina universa), heavily calcified specimens with TE-homogeneous outer calcite (Pulleniatina obliquiloculata), or when all chambers in multichambered species are analyzed by the laser and averaged together (Trilobatus sacculifer and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). We highlight potential issues in interpreting and comparing studies that use different analytical techniques and recommend that the paleoceanographic community establish accepted protocols for generating IFA that would maximize our ability to cross-compare paleoceanographic data and reconstructions when different analytical techniques are used.},

@article{zhangIncreasedVentilationAntarctic2013,
	abstract = {The mid-Pliocene warm period is a recent warm geological period that shares similarities with predictions of future climate. It is generally held the mid-Pliocene Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation must have been stronger, to explain a weak Atlantic meridional δ13C gradient and large northern high-latitude warming. However, climate models do not simulate such stronger Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, when forced with mid-Pliocene boundary conditions. Proxy reconstructions allow for an alternative scenario that the weak δ13C gradient can be explained by increased ventilation and reduced stratification in the Southern Ocean. Here this alternative scenario is supported by simulations with the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-L), which simulate an intensified and slightly poleward shifted wind field off Antarctica, giving enhanced ventilation and reduced stratification in the Southern Ocean. Our findings challenge the prevailing theory and show how increased Southern Ocean ventilation can reconcile existing model-data discrepancies about Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation while explaining fundamental ocean features.},

@article{yuMgCaBenthic2008,
	abstract = {Magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios in two widely used benthic foraminiferal species, Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Cibicidoides mundulus (Cibicidoides kullenbergi), picked from global ocean core-tops and from six cores in the North Atlantic Ocean have been measured to investigate Mg/Ca variability, cleaning effect, and influences from bottom water temperature (BWT) and deep water carbonate ion saturation (Δ[CO32−]). Replicate measurements of the two species reveal Mg/Ca variability of 0.07 $\pm$ 0.07 mmol/mol. Compared with Mg/Ca in samples cleaned by oxidative cleaning, Mg/Ca ratios are significantly lowered, by 0.10 $\pm$ 0.09 mmol/mol, in samples cleaned by reductive cleaning, likely due to preferential leaching during the reductive cleaning step. The cleaning influence is large relative to glacial--interglacial Mg/Ca changes (0.05--0.31 mmol/mol by this study). Regression of core-top data from a wide range of locations show that C. wuellerstorfi Mg/Ca is strongly affected by deep water Δ[CO32−] with a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}0.009 mmol/mol per µmol/kg. When BWT is included in regressions, the correlation is slightly more significant with a weak BWT sensitivity on Mg/Ca of between 0.03 $\pm$ 0.01 and 0.07 $\pm$ 0.02 mmol/mol per $\,^{\circ}$C. Because Δ[CO32−] and BWT covary for most core-top samples, an alternate method of separating the two effects was made by comparing glacial to interglacial changes in Mg/Ca from a depth transect of North Atlantic cores where the BWT and carbonate ion histories since the last glacial period have been well constrained. Results from this transect suggest that the BWT effect is b 0.03 mmol/mol per $\,^{\circ}$C, weaker than inferred from the core-top study. Therefore, core-top and down core data suggest that C. wuellerstorfi Mg/Ca is insensitive to BWT changes. The weak BWT effect, when compared with natural variability, complicates the use of Mg/Ca in this species to reconstruct past BWT. Taking all measured samples from various environments into account, C. mundulus Mg/Ca ratios show no correlation with BWT or deep water Δ[CO32−].},

Although a number of different mechanisms have been proposed to initiate this cooling and the onset of major Northern Hemisphere glaciation, reductions in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 likely played a key role. The emergence of a stratified (halocline) water column in the subarctic northwest Pacific Ocean at 2.73 Ma has often been interpreted as an event which would have limited oceanic ventilation of CO2 to the atmosphere, thereby helping to cool the global climate system. Here diatom carbon isotopes (δ13Cdiatom) are used to reconstruct changes in regional carbon dynamics through this interval. Results show that the development of a salinity stratification did not fundamentally alter the net oceanic/atmospheric flux of CO2 in the subarctic northwest Pacific Ocean through the late Pliocene/early Quaternary. These results provide further insights into the long-term controls on global carbon cycling and the role of the subarctic Pacific Ocean in instigating global climatic changes.},

The δ18O(diatom) and U37k sea surface reconstructions indicate both a significant freshening of 2--4 practical salinity units and an increase in surface temperatures in the summer to early winter period from circa 2.73 Ma onward. In contrast, the concomitant increase in δ18O(foram) is likely to be reflective of conditions beneath the mesothermal structure and/or spring conditions when warmer sea surface temperatures are not present in the region. These results are consistent with the development of the modern halocline system at 2.73 Ma with year-round stratification of the water column and a strengthened seasonal thermocline during the summer to early winter period, resulting in one of the largest summer to winter temperature gradients in the open ocean. The onset of stratification would also have led to a warm pool of surface water from circa 2.73 Ma, which may have provided a potential source of extra moisture needed to supply the growing North American ice sheets at this time.},

In contrast, our new submillennial-scale paleoceanographic records from the Pliocene North Atlantic suggest a far more precise timing and forcing for the initiation of northern hemisphere glaciation (NHG), since it was linked to a 2--3 8C surface water warming during warm stages from 2.95 to 2.82 Ma. These records support previous models [G.H. Haug, R. Tiedemann, Effect of the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation, Nature 393 (1998) 673--676.[2]] claiming that the final closure of the Panama Isthmus (3.0-- {\textasciitilde}2.5 Ma [J. Groeneveld S. Steph, R. Tiedemann, D. Nu¨ rnberg, D. Garbe-Scho¨ nberg, The final closure of the Central American Seaway, Geology, in prep.

Associated strengthening of North Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation and in turn, an intensified moisture supply to northern high latitudes resulted in the build-up of NHG, finally culminating in the great, irreversible bclimate crashQ at marine isotope stage G6 (2.74 Ma). In summary, there was a two-step threshold mechanism that marked the onset of NHG with glacial-to-interglacial cycles quasi-persistent until today.},

	abstract = {We analysed Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ca isotope ratios of benthonic foraminifers from sediment core tops retrieved during several research cruises in the Atlantic Ocean, in order to improve the understanding of isotope fractionation and element partitioning resulting from biomineralisation processes and changes in ambient conditions. Species include foraminifers secreting tests composed of hyaline low magnesium calcite, porcelaneous high magnesium calcite as well as aragonite. Our results demonstrate systematic isotope fractionation and element partitioning patterns specific for these foraminiferal groups. Calcium isotope fractionation is similar in porcelaneous and hyaline calcite tests and both groups demonstrate the previously described anomaly with enrichment of heavy isotopes around 3--4$\,^{\circ}$C (Gussone and Filipsson, 2010). Calcium isotope ratios of the aragonitic species Hoeglundina elegans, on the other hand, are about 0.4‰ lighter compared to the calcitic species, which is in general agreement with stronger fractionation in inorganic aragonite compared to calcite. However, the low and strongly variable Sr content suggests additional processes during test formation, and we propose that transmembrane ion transport or a precursor phase to aragonite may be involved. Porcelaneous tests, composed of high Mg calcite, incorporate higher amounts of Sr compared to hyaline low Mg calcite, in agreement with inorganic calcite systematics, but also porcelaneous tests with reduced Mg/Ca show high Sr/Ca. While calcium isotopes, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in benthonic foraminifers primarily appear to fractionate and partition with a dominant inorganic control, δ44/40Ca temperature and growth rate dependencies of benthonic foraminifer tests favour a dominant contribution of light Ca by transmembrane transport relative to unfractionated seawater Ca to the calcifying fluid, thus controlling the formation of foraminiferal δ44/40Ca and Sr/Ca proxy signals.},

	abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of the infaunal benthic foraminifer Uvigerina peregrina is a commonly used proxy for reconstructing bottom water paleotemperatures because it is hypothesized to be insensitive to changes in bottom water carbonate chemistry. This study presents core-top U. peregrina samples from the southwest Pacific from 0.6 to 4.4 km water depth, corresponding to water temperatures of 1--9 $\,^{\circ}$C. Samples from New Zealand's Bay of Plenty and Chatham Rise were compared to previous calibrations to assess Mg/Ca temperature sensitivity. Published core-top temperature sensitivies can explain U. peregrina Mg/Ca at a majority of our study sites, with the exception of sites at intermediate depths of {\textasciitilde}2.4--3.3 km, where the Mg/Ca ratios are substantially higher than expected from these calibrations, possibly reflecting diagenetic or non-thermal effects. Stable isotope measurements (δ18O and δ13C), laser ablation analyses, and scanning electron microscope imagery complement trace element measurements to assess variables potentially affecting U. peregrina Mg/Ca at these sites. Morphotype variability, contamination, dissolution, and recrystallization all failed to provide satisfactory explanations for anomalously high Mg/Ca observations. We infer that a non-temperature control, perhaps related to carbonate chemistry, may be affecting the Mg incorporation in some U. peregrina specimens, though no factor has yet been clearly identified. It is unclear whether the factor affecting these sites is constant through time or could vary. For this reason, we recommend that Mg/Ca of recent specimens at each core site should be checked against established calibration curves prior to pursuing down-core paleotemperature reconstructions using U. peregrina. Where possible, paleotemperature estimates should also be validated using other independent proxies. Existing core-top calibrations effectively predict U. peregrina Mg/Ca at the majority of our study sites, but our findings underscore the need for a more thorough understanding of non-temperature factors that can influence Mg/Ca in U. peregrina.},

	abstract = {We have generated benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records from eastern tropical Atlantic core M16772 (3.9 km) and eastern tropical Pacific core TR163-31P (3.2 km) to assess the potential for using benthic Mg-paleothermometry to reconstruct Quaternary bottom water temperature histories. Variations in Mg/Ca records from both the Atlantic and Pacific show a significant correlation with climatic oscillations of the last 330 kyr. Shell Mg/Ca peaks during interglacial episodes, with marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e Mg/Ca nearly matching Holocene values in both cores. Lower Mg/Ca values occur during glacial intervals. To estimate temperatures from downcore Mg/Ca, we have augmented the published Cibicidoides sp. Mg/Ca{\textasciicircum}temperature dataset [Rosenthal et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 3633{\textasciicircum}3643] with new data to include the temperature range of deep waters. Applying the 10.9\% change in Mg/Ca per ‡C defined by the expanded calibration to the deep Atlantic data implies glacial{\textasciicircum}interglacial shifts in deep water temperature of 2{\textasciicircum}4‡C over the last 300 kyr. Temperature estimates are comparable to deep Atlantic temperature changes proposed by Labeyrie et al. [Nature 327 (1987) 477{\textasciicircum}482]. There is greater uncertainty in deriving temperatures from the tropical Pacific core due to a limited Uvigerina spp. core top calibration set; however, glacial{\textasciicircum} interglacial temperature oscillations appear to be on the order of 2{\textasciicircum}3‡C. In addition, core TR163-31P records clear millennial-scale Mg/Ca and N18O oscillations in MIS 3 corresponding to temperature fluctuations of s 0.5‡C. Additional calibration studies are needed to address potential secondary effects on Mg/Ca. {\ss} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using bathymetric transects of surface sediments underlying similar sea surface temperatures but exposed to increasing dissolution, we examined the processes which affect the relationship between foraminiferal Mg/Ca and δ18O. We found that Globigerinoides saccculifer calcifies over a relatively large range of water depth and that this is apparent in their Mg content. On the seafloor, foraminiferal Mg/Ca is substantially altered by dissolution with the degree of alteration increasing with water depth. Selective dissolution of the chamber calcite, formed in surface waters, shifts the shell's bulk Mg/Ca and δ18O toward the chemistries of the secondary crust acquired in colder thermocline waters. The magnitude of this shift depends on both the range of temperatures over which the shell calcified and the degree to which it is subsequently dissolved. In spite of this shift the initial relationship between Mg/Ca and δ18O, determined by their temperature dependence, is maintained. We conclude that paired measurements of δ18O and Mg/Ca can be used for reconstructing δ18Owater, though care must be taken to determine where in the water column the reconstruction applies.},

	abstract = {Foraminiferal tests are a common component of many marine sediments. The oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) of test calcite is frequently used to reconstruct aspects of their life environment. The δ18O depends mainly on the isotope ratio of the water it is precipitated from, the temperature of calcification, and, to a lesser extent, the carbonate ion concentration. Foraminifera and other organisms can potentially preserve their original isotope ratio for many millions of years, although diagenetic processes can alter the ratios. Work on oxygen isotope ratios of foraminifera was instrumental in the discovery of the orbital theory of the ice ages and continues to be widely used in the study of rapid climate change. Compilations of deep sea benthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes have revealed the long history of global climate change over the past 100 million years. Planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotopes are used to investigate the history of past sea surface temperatures, revealing the extent of past 'greenhouse' warming and global sea surface temperatures.},

The prominent 1470-year spectral peak, which has been associated with the occurrence of Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadial events, is solely caused by Dansgaard-Oeschger events 5, 6, and 7. This result emphasizes the nonstationary character of the oxygen isotope time series. Nevertheless, a fundamental pacing period of ∼1470 years seems to control the timing of the onset of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. A trapezoidal time series model is introduced which provides a template for the pacing of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Statistical analysis indicates only a ≤3\% probability that the number of matches between observed and template-derived onsets of Dansgaard-Oeschger events between 13 and 46 kyr B.P. resulted by chance. During this interval the spacing of the Dansgaard-Oeschger onsets varied by $\pm$20\% around the fundamental 1470-year period and multiples thereof. The pacing seems unaffected by variations in the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, suggesting that the thermohaline circulation was not the primary controlling factor of the pacing period.},

@article{timmermannCoherentResonantMillennialScale2003,
	abstract = {Abstract The role of mean and stochastic freshwater forcing on the generation of millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic is studied using a low-order coupled atmosphere--ocean--sea ice model. It is shown that millennial-scale oscillations can be excited stochastically, when the North Atlantic Ocean is fresh enough. This finding is used in order to interpret the aftermath of massive iceberg surges (Heinrich events) in the glacial North Atlantic, which are characterized by an excitation of Dansgaard--Oeschger events. Based on model results, it is hypothesized that Heinrich events trigger Dansgaard--Oeschger cycles and that furthermore the occurrence of Heinrich events is dependent on the accumulated climatic effect of a series of Dansgaard--Oeschger events. This scenario leads to a coupled ocean--ice sheet oscillation that shares many similarities with the Bond cycle. Further sensitivity experiments reveal that the timescale of the oscillations can be decomposed into stochastic, linear, and nonlinear deterministic components. A schematic bifurcation diagram is used to compare theoretical results with paleoclimatic data.},

	abstract = {Last Glacial millennial-scale climate variability transitioned through distinct cold stadial and warm interstadial states. Here we use Earth system model simulations to demonstrate that nonlinear self-sustained climate oscillations appear spontaneously within a window of glacial-level atmospheric CO2 concentrations ({\textasciitilde}190--225 parts per million). Outside this window, the system remains in either quasi-stable cold low CO2 or warm high CO2 states, with infrequent and abrupt random transitions driven by noise. In the oscillatory regime, the time between climate transitions is governed by temporal variations in the state of the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice, with CO2 acting as a control on the relative rates of the internal forcing and feedback in the system. The Earth system model results map perfectly to a slow--fast dynamical systems model, where the fixed point of the system transitions into the oscillatory regime through a loss of stability at two critical tipping points, the window boundaries. The deterministic component of the oscillations is modified by a stochastic element associated with internal climate variability. Agreement between observations and the hierarchically disparate models suggests the existence of an internal stochastic climate oscillator, which tracks variations in atmospheric CO2 level through the glacial, acting in concert with noise-induced transitions.},

@article{ventiStableisotopeStratigraphyPliocene2012,
	abstract = {From Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1208 on Shatsky Rise below the Kuroshio Current Extension, we present the North Pacific's first orbital-scale benthic-foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C time series to span the Pliocene--Pleistocene climate transition. Excellent agreement between the Site 1208 δ18O record and the global δ18O stack of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) provides orbital-scale age control and confirms continuous stratigraphy from 3.7 to 1.8Ma at the single-hole site. Cross-spectral analysis of the δ18O and δ13C time series reveals that these are coherent to 80\% confidence at the 41-kyr obliquity band prior to 3.3Ma (glacial isotope stage M2) and increase to the 95\% level thereafter. Throughout, δ18O cycles consistently lead δ13C cycles by {\textasciitilde}3kyr. This suggests that global-ocean δ13C variations, as produced by terrestrial--marine 12C transfers, were responsive to obliquity-induced climate changes before the Northern Hemisphere glaciations (NHG) reached mid latitudes at 2.7Ma. In contrast, 41-kyr carbonate sedimentation (as derived from sediment reflectance) cycles, maxima tightly coupled to ({\textgreater}95\% confidence) and in phase with minima in the δ18O record, do not emerge until 2.7Ma. Foraminiferal fragmentation counts indicate that carbonate preservation is not the primary process behind enhanced carbonate deposition during interglacials. Thus, we surmise that hydrography-related changes in biogenic opal and carbonate production in surface water best explain glacial--interglacial carbonate cycles beginning with significant NHG. Firm establishment of orbital-scale age control on the stratigraphically complete Site 1208 section now provides a platform for high-resolution paleoceanographic reconstruction of the relatively understudied North Pacific.},

@article{brierleyComparingImpactsMiocene2016,
	abstract = {Changes in inter-ocean gateways caused by tectonic processes have been long considered an important factor in climate evolution on geological timescales. Three major gateway changes that occurred during the Late Miocene and Pliocene epochs are the closing of the Central American Seaway (CAS) by the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama, the opening of the Bering Strait, and the closing of a deep channel between New Guinea and the Equator. This study compares the global climatic effects of these changes within the same climate model framework. We find that the closure of the CAS and the opening of the Bering Strait induce the strongest effects on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). However, these effects potentially compensate, as the closure of the CAS and the opening of the Bering Strait cause similar AMOC changes of around 2 Sv (strengthening and weakening respectively). Previous simulations with an open CAS consistently simulated colder oceanic conditions in the Northern Hemisphere -- contrasting with the evidence for warmer sea surface temperatures 10--3 million years ago. Here we argue that this cooling is overestimated because (a) the models typically simulated too strong an AMOC change not yet in equilibrium, (b) used a channel too deep and (c) lacked the compensating effect of the closed Bering Strait -- a factor frequently ignored despite its potential influence on northern high latitudes and ice-sheet growth. Further, we discuss how these gateway changes affect various climatic variables from surface temperature and precipitation to ENSO characteristics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              It has long been believed that climate shifts during the last 2 million years had a pivotal role in the evolution of our genus
              Homo
              1--3
              . However, given the limited number of representative palaeo-climate datasets from regions of anthropological interest, it has remained challenging to quantify this linkage. Here, we use an unprecedented transient Pleistocene coupled general circulation model simulation in combination with an extensive compilation of fossil and archaeological records to study the spatiotemporal habitat suitability for five hominin species over the past 2 million years. We show that astronomically forced changes in temperature, rainfall and terrestrial net primary production had a major impact on the observed distributions of these species. During the Early Pleistocene, hominins settled primarily in environments with weak orbital-scale climate variability. This behaviour changed substantially after the mid-Pleistocene transition, when archaic humans became global wanderers who adapted to a wide range of spatial climatic gradients. Analysis of the simulated hominin habitat overlap from approximately 300--400 thousand years ago further suggests that antiphased climate disruptions in southern Africa and Eurasia contributed to the evolutionary transformation of
              Homo heidelbergensis
              populations into
              Homo sapiens
              and Neanderthals, respectively. Our robust numerical simulations of climate-induced habitat changes provide a framework to test hypotheses on our human origin.},

@article{schmittnerCalibrationCarbonIsotope2017,
	abstract = {The carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of seawater provides valuable insight on ocean circulation, air-sea exchange, the biological pump, and the global carbon cycle and is reflected by the δ13C of foraminifera tests. Here more than 1700 δ13C observations of the benthic foraminifera genus Cibicides from late Holocene sediments (δ13CCibnat) are compiled and compared with newly updated estimates of the natural (preindustrial) water column δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13CDICnat) as part of the international Ocean Circulation and Carbon Cycling (OC3) project. Using selection criteria based on the spatial distance between samples, we find high correlation between δ13CCibnat and δ13CDICnat, confirming earlier work. Regression analyses indicate significant carbonate ion (−2.6 $\pm$ 0.4) × 10−3‰/(μmol kg−1) [CO32−] and pressure (−4.9 $\pm$ 1.7) × 10−5‰ m−1 (depth) effects, which we use to propose a new global calibration for predicting δ13CDICnat from δ13CCibnat. This calibration is shown to remove some systematic regional biases and decrease errors compared with the one-to-one relationship (δ13CDICnat = δ13CCibnat). However, these effects and the error reductions are relatively small, which suggests that most conclusions from previous studies using a one-to-one relationship remain robust. The remaining standard error of the regression is generally σ ≅ 0.25‰, with larger values found in the southeast Atlantic and Antarctic (σ ≅ 0.4‰) and for species other than Cibicides wuellerstorfi. Discussion of species effects and possible sources of the remaining errors may aid future attempts to improve the use of the benthic δ13C record.},

@article{langTransitionNorthAmerica2014,
	abstract = {We present Plio-Pleistocene records of sediment color, \%CaCO3, foraminifer fragmentation, benthic carbon isotopes (δ13C) and radiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb) of the terrigenous component from IODP Site U1313, a reoccupation of benchmark subtropical North Atlantic Ocean DSDP Site 607. We show that (inter)glacial cycles in sediment color and \%CaCO3 pre-date major northern hemisphere glaciation and are unambiguously and consistently correlated to benthic oxygen isotopes back to 3.3 million years ago (Ma) and intermittently so probably back to the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. We show these lithological cycles to be driven by enhanced glacial fluxes of terrigenous material (eolian dust), not carbonate dissolution (the classic interpretation). Our radiogenic isotope data indicate a North American source for this dust (∼3.3--2.4 Ma) in keeping with the interpreted source of terrestrial plant wax-derived biomarkers deposited at Site U1313. Yet our data indicate a mid latitude provenance regardless of (inter)glacial state, a finding that is inconsistent with the biomarker-inferred importance of glaciogenic mechanisms of dust production and transport. Moreover, we find that the relation between the biomarker and lithogenic components of dust accumulation is distinctly non-linear. Both records show a jump in glacial rates of accumulation from Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, G6 (2.72 Ma) onwards but the amplitude of this signal is about 3--8 times greater for biomarkers than for dust and particularly extreme during MIS 100 (2.52 Ma). We conclude that North America shifted abruptly to a distinctly more arid glacial regime from MIS G6, but major shifts in glacial North American vegetation biomes and regional wind fields (exacerbated by the growth of a large Laurentide Ice Sheet during MIS 100) likely explain amplification of this signal in the biomarker records. Our findings are consistent with wetter-than-modern reconstructions of North American continental climate under the warm high CO2 conditions of the Early Pliocene but contrast with most model predictions for the response of the hydrological cycle to anthropogenic warming over the coming 50 years (poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones).},

The benthic foraminiferal genus Cibicidoides is widely used in paleoceanographic reconstructions because of its epifaunal habitat and cosmopolitan distribution, and it has received early attention in Mg/Ca work. However, existing temperature calibrations for Cibicidoides rely heavily on C. pachyderma core top data from one location, Little Bahamas Bank, where authigenic processes and/or reworking may result in elevated warm water Mg/Ca values. Here we present new C. pachyderma Mg/Ca data from a series of 29 high-quality multicore tops collected in the Florida Straits, spanning a temperature range of 5.8--18.6$\,^{\circ}$C. In contrast to previous calibrations, we find no evidence for a strongly exponential response to temperature. The data are best explained by a linear relationship, with a sensitivity of 0.12 mmol mol−1 per $\,^{\circ}$C.},

@article{wilkensRevisitingCearaRise2017,
	abstract = {Isotope stratigraphy has become the method of choice for investigating both past ocean temperatures and global ice volume. Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) published a stacked record of 57 globally distributed benthic δ18O records versus age (LR04 stack). In this study LR04 is compared to high-resolution records collected at all of the sites drilled during ODP Leg 154 on the Ceara Rise, in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Newly developed software is used to check data splices of the Ceara Rise sites and better align out-of-splice data with in-splice data. Core images recovered from core table photos are depth and age scaled and greatly assist in the data analysis. The entire splices of ODP sites 925, 926, 927, 928 and 929 were reviewed. Most changes were minor although several were large enough to affect age models based on orbital tuning. A Ceara Rise composite record of benthic δ18O is out of sync with LR04 between 1.80 and 1.90 Ma, where LR04 exhibits two maxima but Ceara Rise data contain only one. The interval between 4.0 and 4.5 Ma in the Ceara Rise compilation is decidedly different from LR04, reflecting both the low amplitude of the signal over this interval and the limited amount of data available for the LR04 stack. A regional difference in benthic δ18O of 0.2 ‰ relative to LR04 was found. Independent tuning of Site 926 images and physical property data to the Laskar et al. (2004) orbital solution and integration of available benthic stable isotope data from the Ceara Rise provides a new regional reference section for the equatorial Atlantic covering the last 5 million years.},

	abstract = {New benthic foraminiferal stable isotopic records of northeast Pacific intermediate water (ODP Site 1014, 1177 m) and mid-depth water (ODP Site 1018, 2476 m) were compared to isotopic records of deep water in the tropical Pacific (ODP Site 849, 3851 m) for the reconstruction of vertical profiles of nutrient and physical properties from the Early Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene (approx. 5--1.4 Ma). Our data indicate that, for the entire interval, there was enhanced north Pacific intermediate water ventilation relative to today, and a similar to modern circulation pattern with northward flowing Pacific Bottom Water (PBW) beneath its southward flowing return flow. However, the core of maximally aged return flow resided as deep as ∼2500 m (as compared to ∼1500 m today), probably due to the strengthened intermediate water flow. Less apparent aging of deep water along its path before 2.7 Ma indicates that thermohaline overturning may have been more rapid in the warm period of the Early Pliocene. In addition, prior to 2.7 Ma, foraminiferal oxygen isotopic values at mid-depth sites are higher than at deep sites (a reversed vertical gradient relative to today) in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We suggest that NADW was warmer and more saline than today and that it influenced mid-depth waters throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Enhanced Pliocene formation of warmer/saltier intermediate water in the north Pacific, and deep water in the north Atlantic, may have been a result of higher than modern high/mid-latitude sea surface temperatures, evaporation, and salinity.},

	abstract = {An important stage in global ocean overturning circulation is the upwelling of the Antarctic Bottom Water into the Pacific Deep Water. The long-term evolution of Pacific Deep Water circulation, however, is scarcely addressed. We use seismic reflection data and cores from the International Ocean Discovery Program (and its predecessors) in contourites to reconstruct regional deep ocean circulation patterns. Here we demonstrate that Pacific Deep Water circulation was progressively enhanced at about 4.35, 3.84, 2.16, and 0.97 Ma since the early Pliocene. Coeval growth of volcanic arcs and tectonic uplifts gradually isolated marginal seas from the Pacific Deep Water and, in conjunction with climate cooling, effectively increasing deep-water flux within a shrinking Pacific basin. Regional stratigraphic discontinuities in contourites indicate thresholds in the intensification of ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {A shallow marine sediment core from NW Iceland provides evidence for a brief cooling and freshening at {\textasciitilde}8200 cal yr BP, consistent with the hypothesis that the catastrophic outburst flood of the proglacial lakes Oijbway and Agassiz caused the 8.2 ka event. This is the first high-resolution record reconstructing near-surface temperatures and δ18Osw by paired measurements of Mg/Ca and δ18Ocalcite of a benthic foraminifer. We developed a new Mg/Ca temperature calibration for Cibicides lobatulus. Our down-core Mg/Ca derived temperature reconstruction dates the 8.2 ka cooling event between {\textasciitilde}8300 cal yr BP and {\textasciitilde}8100 cal yr BP, which is similar to the timing and 160-yr duration recorded in the Greenland ice cores. The near-surface temperature drop of {\textasciitilde}3 to 5$\,^{\circ}$C during the 8.2 ka event was accompanied by lighter δ18Osw values. Synchronously to the changes in the geochemical proxies, the percentages of two Arctic benthic foraminifers increased and the percent calcium carbonate decreased. Our record, combined with several others from the region, suggests that the freshwater outburst spread far from the source into the high-latitude North Atlantic. This freshwater input could have directly caused substantial high-latitude cooling, with reduced North Atlantic Deep Water formation amplifying the climatic impact.},

@article{rosenthalInterlaboratoryComparisonStudy2004,
	abstract = {Thirteen laboratories from the USA and Europe participated in an intercomparison study of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measurements in foraminifera. The study included five planktonic species from surface sediments from different geographical regions and water depths. Each of the laboratories followed their own cleaning and analytical procedures and had no specific information about the samples. Analysis of solutions of known Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios showed that the intralaboratory instrumental precision is better than 0.5\% for both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measurements, regardless whether ICP-OES or ICP-MS is used. The interlaboratory precision on the analysis of standard solutions was about 1.5\% and 0.9\% for Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca measurements, respectively. These are equivalent to Mg/Ca-based temperature repeatability and reproducibility on the analysis of solutions of $\pm$0.2$\,^{\circ}$C and $\pm$0.5$\,^{\circ}$C, respectively. The analysis of foraminifera suggests an interlaboratory variance of about $\pm$8\% (\%RSD) for Mg/Ca measurements, which translates to reproducibility of about $\pm$2--3$\,^{\circ}$C. The relatively large range in the reproducibility of foraminiferal analysis is primarily due to relatively poor intralaboratory repeatability (about $\pm$1--2$\,^{\circ}$C) and a bias (about 1$\,^{\circ}$C) due to the application of different cleaning methods by different laboratories. Improving the consistency of cleaning methods among laboratories will, therefore, likely lead to better reproducibility. Even more importantly, the results of this study highlight the need for standards calibration among laboratories as a first step toward improving interlaboratory compatibility.},

@article{chadwickReconstructingAntarcticWinter2022,
	abstract = {Abstract. Environmental conditions during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e (130--116 ka)
represent an important ``process analogue'' for understanding the climatic
responses to present and future anthropogenic warming. The response of
Antarctic sea ice to global warming is particularly uncertain due to the
short length of the observational record. Reconstructing Antarctic winter
sea-ice extent during MIS 5e therefore provides insights into the temporal
and spatial patterns of sea-ice change under a warmer-than-present climate.
This study presents new MIS 5e records from nine marine sediment cores
located south of the Antarctic Polar Front between 55 and 70∘ S.
Winter sea-ice extent and sea-surface temperatures are reconstructed using
marine diatom assemblages and a modern analogue technique transfer function,
and changes in these environmental variables between the three Southern
Ocean sectors are investigated. The Atlantic and East Indian sector records
show much more variable MIS 5e winter sea-ice extent and sea-surface
temperatures than the Pacific sector records. High variability in the
Atlantic sector winter sea-ice extent is attributed to high glacial
meltwater flux in the Weddell Sea, indicated by increased abundances of the
diatom species Eucampia antarctica and Fragilariopsis cylindrus. The high variability in the East Indian sector winter
sea-ice extent is conversely believed to result from large latitudinal
migrations of the flow bands of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, inferred
from latitudinal shifts in the sea-surface temperature isotherms. Overall,
these findings suggest that Pacific sector winter sea ice displays a low
sensitivity to warmer climates. The different variability and sensitivity of Antarctic winter sea-ice extent in the three Southern Ocean sectors during MIS 5e may have significant implications for the Southern Hemisphere
climatic system under future warming.},

There is indirect paleoevidences from the last glacial termination as well as from the early and middle Pliocene that this halocline has not always been there. To study the effects of North Pacific salinity on global climate, ocean circulation and the marine carbon cycle, we perform idealized experiments using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (LOVECLIM). Imposing a negative freshwater flux in the northern North Pacific, the halocline vanishes and a deep Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) establishes. The associated increase of meridional heat transport in the Pacific leads to a bipolar seesaw response in temperature, with warming in the North Pacific and over North America and cooling in the Southern Ocean. As a result of the formation of North Pacific deep water (NPDW), the surface branch of the global conveyor belt circulation weakens. Transport through the Indonesian Seas decreases by 50\% as the warm and saline waters of the equatorial Pacific are diverted into the North Pacific.},

              Most of the densest, deepest water at the bottom of the oceans comes from two regions, the North Atlantic and the circum-Antarctic. Have other regions been able to produce significant quantities of deep water in the past? For decades, researchers have looked, with limited success, for evidence of deepwater formation in the North Pacific since the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, about 23,000 years ago.

The switch between deep-water formation in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific is likely to have had an important effect on heat transport and climate.

            The Atlantic was not the only ocean in the Northern Hemisphere in which deep water formed during the last deglaciation.
          , 
            Between {\textasciitilde}17,500 and 15,000 years ago, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakened substantially in response to meltwater discharges from disintegrating Northern Hemispheric glacial ice sheets. The global effects of this reorganization of poleward heat flow in the North Atlantic extended to Antarctica and the North Pacific. Here we present evidence from North Pacific paleo surface proxy data, a compilation of marine radiocarbon age ventilation records, and global climate model simulations to suggest that during the early stages of the Last Glacial Termination, deep water extending to a depth of {\textasciitilde}2500 to 3000 meters was formed in the North Pacific. A switch of deepwater formation between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific played a key role in regulating poleward oceanic heat transport during the Last Glacial Termination.},

@techreport{degraafMillennialScaleVariability2021,
	abstract = {Climate during the last glacial period was marked by instability on millennial timescales that included rapid changes in Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures. Evidence suggests that this millennial-scale variability was a persistent feature of glacials into the Early Pleistocene, when glacial boundary conditions differed considerably from the Late Pleistocene. This project used high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis to study the millennial-scale variability in the flux of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) and ocean circulation over ODP Sites 980 and 981 on the Feni Drift in the Rockall Trough. By comparison to previous IRD studies at the site, it was shown that a high-pass Zr/Sr ratio can reliably predict periods of increased IRD flux. Moreover, this record was then used to infer a number of ``modes'' of millennial-scale variability during the Pleistocene with transitions at 1.75 Ma, 900 ka and 600 ka. Notably, this project found that changes in the British-Irish Ice Sheet may play a role in the increased IRD flux to the site after MIS 62 (1.75 Ma), and decreased IRD flux to the site after MIS 16 (600 ka). Furthermore, this project used XRF analysis to infer changes in flow speeds over the Feni Drift, at depths of c.2100 m, and from this suggest a stagnant Arctic Ocean may have existed during glacials for the whole Pleistocene. Altogether, this project highlights that high-resolution XRF analysis can provide a rapid, powerful tool to unravel millennial-scale variability across the Pleistocene, identifying regions of interest for further geochemical analysis.},

In regions outside of the Arctic Ocean area, the grid uses as a base Version 2.2 of the SRTM15\_plus data set (Tozer, B. et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. Included on top of this base grid are gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Regional Centers of The Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. The GEBCO\_2021 Grid represents all data within the 2021 compilation. The compilation of the GEBCO\_2021 Grid was carried out at the Seabed 2030 Global Center, hosted at the National Oceanography Centre, UK, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model. Outside of Polar regions, the Regional Centers provide their data sets as sparse grids i.e. only grid cells that contain data are populated. These data sets were included on to the base grid without any blending. The data sets supplied in the form of complete grids (primarily areas north of 60N and south of 50S) were included using feather blending techniques from GlobalMapper software. The GEBCO\_2021 Grid has been developed through the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. This is a collaborative project between the Nippon Foundation of Japan and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO). It aims to bring together all available bathymetric data to produce the definitive map of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it available to all. Funded by the Nippon Foundation, the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers include the Southern Ocean - hosted at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany; South and West Pacific Ocean - hosted at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand; Atlantic and Indian Oceans - hosted at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, USA; Arctic and North Pacific Oceans - hosted at Stockholm University, Sweden and the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the University of New Hampshire, USA.},

Recent work suggests that CO2 storage in the deep Atlantic Ocean played an important role in these events but detailed reconstructions of deep ocean chemical stratification are needed to test this idea and competing hypotheses. Here we present new records of the Nd isotope composition of fish debris and d13C and B/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera from the northwest and southeast Atlantic Ocean. Our novel geochemical data show that, in contrast to major Quaternary glaciations such as MIS 2 ({\textasciitilde}21 ka) and MIS 100 ({\textasciitilde}2.52 Ma), the deep North Atlantic Ocean was weakly chemically stratified during MIS M2. We show that Southern Component Water incursion into the Atlantic Ocean was limited to the deep South Atlantic basin during MIS M2 and peaked well before ({\textasciitilde}10-15-kyr) the atmospheric CO2 minimum. Our findings imply that the deep Atlantic Ocean was not the principle sink of CO2 sequestered from the atmosphere during MIS M2, implicating a different CO2 storage deep-water reservoir mechanism, presumably Southern Component Water incursion into the Pacific Ocean. Weak chemical stratification in the deep Atlantic Ocean during MIS M2 relative to MIS 100 and 2 suggests comparatively active Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. That suggestion is consistent with the warmth of the high latitude North Atlantic during MIS M2 e surface water temperatures cooled during M2 but only close to Holocene values. Our findings may help to explain the paucity of evidence for extensive early glaciation of the northern hemisphere during M2 but leave open the possibility of ice sheet advance on Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Epibenthic foraminifer δ13C measurements are valuable for reconstructing past bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon δ13C (δ13CDIC), which are used to infer global ocean circulation patterns. Epibenthic δ13C, however, may also reflect the influence of 13C-depleted phytodetritus, microhabitat changes, and/or variations in carbonate ion concentrations. Here we compare the δ13C of two benthic foraminifer species, Cibicides kullenbergi and Cibicides wuellerstorfi, and their morphotypes, in three sub-Antarctic Atlantic sediment cores over several glacial-interglacial transitions. These species are commonly assumed to be epibenthic, living above or directly below the sediment-water interface. While this might be consistent with the small δ13C offset that we observe between these species during late Pleistocene interglacial periods (Δδ13C = −0.19 $\pm$ 0.31‰, N = 63), it is more difficult to reconcile with the significant δ13C offset that is found between these species during glacial periods (Δδ13C = −0.76 $\pm$ 0.44‰, N = 44). We test possible scenarios by analyzing Uvigerina spp. δ13C and benthic foraminifer abundances: (1) C. kullenbergi δ13C is biased to light values either due to microhabitat shifts or phytodetritus effects and (2) C. wuellerstorfi δ13C is biased to heavy values, relative to long-term average conditions, for instance by recording the sporadic occurrence of less depleted deepwater δ13CDIC. Neither of these scenarios can be ruled out unequivocally. However, our findings emphasize that supposedly epibenthic foraminifer δ13C in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic may reflect several factors rather than being solely a function of bottom water δ13CDIC. This could have a direct bearing on the interpretation of extremely light South Atlantic δ13C values at the Last Glacial Maximum.},

	abstract = {We reconstruct paleoproductivity at three sites in the Atlantic Ocean (Ocean Drilling Program Sites 982, 925, and 1088) to investigate the presence and extent of the late Miocene to early Pliocene ``biogenic bloom'' from 9 to 3 Ma. Our approach involves construction of multiple records including benthic foraminiferal and CaCO3 accumulation rates, Uvigerina counts, dissolution proxies, and geochemical tracers for biogenic and detrital fluxes. This time interval also contains the so-called late Miocene carbon isotope shift, a well-known decrease in benthic foraminiferal δ13C values. We find that the timing of paleoproductivity maxima differs among the three sites. At Site 982 (North Atlantic), benthic foraminifera and CaCO3 accumulation were both at a maximum at ∼5 Ma, with smaller peaks at ∼6 Ma. The paleoproductivity maximum was centered earlier (∼6.6--6.0 Ma) in the tropical Atlantic (Site 925). In the South Atlantic (Site 1088), paleoproductivity increased even earlier, between 8.2 Ma and 6.2 Ma, and remained relatively high until ∼5.4 Ma. We note that there is some overlap between the interval of maximum productivity between Sites 925 and 1088, as well as the minor productivity increase at Site 982. We conclude that the paleoproductivity results support hypotheses aiming to place the biogenic bloom into a global context of enhanced productivity. In addition, we find that at all three sites the δ13C shift is accompanied by carbonate dissolution. This observation is consistent with published studies that have sought a relationship between the late Miocene carbon isotope shift and carbonate preservation.},

We compare the isotope and lithological proxies at Site U1308 with other North Atlantic records (e.g., sites 982, 607/U1313, and U1304) to reconstruct the history of orbital and millennial-scale climate variability during the Quaternary. The Site U1308 record documents a progressive increase in the intensity of Northern Hemisphere glacial--interglacial cycles during the late Pliocene and Quaternary, with mode transitions at  ∼  2.7, 1.5, 0.9, and 0.65 Ma. These transitions mark times of change in the growth and stability of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. They also coincide with increases in vertical carbon isotope gradients between the intermediate and deep ocean, suggesting changes in deep carbon storage and atmospheric CO2. Orbital and millennial climate variability co-evolved during the Quaternary such that the trend towards larger and thicker ice sheets was accompanied by changes in the style, frequency, and intensity of millennial-scale variability. This co-evolution may be important for explaining the observed patterns of Quaternary climate change.},

@article{guAssessingPotentialCapability2020,
	abstract = {Reconstructing the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is essential for understanding glacial-interglacial climate change and the carbon cycle. However, despite many previous studies, uncertainties remain regarding the glacial water mass distributions in the Atlantic and the AMOC intensity. Here we use an isotope enabled ocean model with multiple geotracers (δ13C, εNd, 231Pa/230Th, δ18O and Δ14C) and idealized water tracers to study the potential constraints on LGM ocean circulation from multiple proxies. Our model suggests that the glacial Atlantic water mass distribution can be accurately constrained by the air-sea gas exchange signature of water masses (δ13CAS), but εNd might overestimate the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) percentage in the deep Atlantic probably because of the boundary source of Nd. A sensitivity experiment with an AMOC of similar geometry but much weaker strength suggests that the correct AMOC geometry is more important than the AMOC strength for simulating the observed glacial δ13C and εNd distributions. The kinematic tracer 231Pa/230Th is sensitive to AMOC intensity, but the interpretation might be complicated by the AMOC geometry and AABW transport changes during the LGM. δ18O in the benthic foraminifera (δ18Oc) from the Florida Straits provides a consistent measure of the upper ocean boundary current in the model, which potentially provides an unambiguous method to reconstruct glacial AMOC intensity. Finally, we propose that the moderate difference between AMOC intensity at LGM and PD, if any, is caused by the competition of the responses to CO2 forcing and continental ice sheet forcing.},

@article{lambeletNeodymiumIsotopicComposition2016,
	abstract = {The neodymium (Nd) isotopic composition of seawater is commonly used as a proxy to study past changes in the thermohaline circulation. The modern database for such reconstructions is however poor and the understanding of the underlying processes is incomplete. Here we present new observational data for Nd isotopes and concentrations from twelve seawater depth profiles, which follow the flow path of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) from its formation region in the North Atlantic to the northern equatorial Atlantic. Samples were collected during two cruises constituting the northern part of the Dutch GEOTRACES transect GA02 in 2010. The results show that the different water masses in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, which ultimately constitute NADW, have the following Nd isotope characteristics: Upper Labrador Sea Water (ULSW), εNd=−14.2$\pm$0.3; Labrador Sea Water (LSW), εNd=−13.7$\pm$0.9; Northeast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW), εNd=−12.5$\pm$0.6; Northwest Atlantic Bottom Water (NWABW), εNd=−11.8$\pm$1.4. In the subtropics, where these source water masses have mixed to form NADW, which is exported to the global ocean, upper-NADW is characterised by εNd values of −13.2$\pm$1.0 (2sd) and lower-NADW exhibits values of εNd=−12.4$\pm$0.4 (2sd). While both signatures overlap within error, the signature for lower-NADW is significantly more radiogenic than the traditionally used value for NADW (εNd=−13.5) due to the dominance of source waters from the Nordic Seas (NWABW and NEADW). Comparison between the concentration profiles and the corresponding Nd isotope profiles with other water mass properties such as salinity, silicate concentrations, neutral densities and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentration provides novel insights into the geochemical cycle of Nd and reveals that different processes are necessary to account for the observed Nd characteristics in the subpolar and subtropical gyres and throughout the vertical water column. While our data set provides additional insights into the contribution of boundary exchange in areas of sediment resuspension, the results for open ocean seawater demonstrate, at an unprecedented level, the suitability of Nd isotopes to trace modern water masses in the strongly advecting western Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {The neodymium isotopic composition of marine precipitates is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for identifying changes in ocean circulation and mixing on million year to millennial timescales. Unlike nutrient proxies such as δ13C or Cd/Ca, Nd isotopes are not thought to be altered in any significant way by biological processes, and thus they can serve as a quasi-conservative water mass tracer. However, the application of Nd isotopes in understanding the role of thermohaline circulation in rapid climate change is currently hindered by the lack of direct constraints on the signature of the North Atlantic end-member through time. Here we present the first results of Nd isotopes measured in U-Th-dated deep-sea corals from the New England seamounts in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that the Nd isotopic composition of North Atlantic deep and intermediate water has remained nearly constant through the last glacial cycle. The results address long-standing concerns that there may have been significant changes in the Nd isotopic composition of the North Atlantic end-member during this interval and substantiate the applicability of this novel tracer on millennial timescales for paleoceanography research.},

Previous water-mass decompositions have described the oceanic interior as being filled by just a few different property combinations, or water masses.

The volume of water originating from each surface location is quantified in a global framework, and can be summarized by the estimate that 15\% of the surface area fills 85\% of the ocean interior volume. Ranked from largest to smallest, the volume contributions scaled by surface area follow a power-law distribution with an exponent of −1.09 $\pm$ 0.03 that appears indicative of the advective-diffusive filling characteristics of the ocean circulation, as demonstrated using a simple model.

	abstract = {Antarctic continental-scale glaciation is generally assumed to have initiated at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition, yet its subsequent evolution is poorly constrained. We reconstruct changes in bottom water temperature and global ice volume from 0 to 17 Ma using δ18O in conjunction with Mg/Ca records of the infaunal benthic foraminifer, O. umbonatus from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 806 (equatorial Pacific; 2500 m). Considering uncertainties in core top calibrations and sensitivity to seawater Mg/Ca (Mg/Ca)sw, we produce a range of Mg/Ca-temperature-Mg/Casw calibrations. Our favored exponential temperature calibration is Mg/Ca = 0.66 $\pm$ 0.08 × Mg/Casw0.27$\pm$0.06 × e(0.114$\pm$0.02 × BWT) and our favored linear temperature calibration is Mg/Ca = (1.21 $\pm$ 0.04 + 0.12 $\pm$ 0.004 × BWT (bottom water temperature)) × (Mg/Casw−0.003$\pm$0.02) (stated errors are 2 s.e.). The equations are obtained by comparing O. umbonatus Mg/Ca for a Paleocene-Eocene section from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690 (Weddell Sea) to δ18O temperatures, calculated assuming ice-free conditions during this peak warmth period of the Cenozoic. This procedure suggests negligible effect of Mg/Casw on the Mg distribution coefficient (DMg). Application of the new equations to the Site 806 record leads to the suggestion that global ice volume was greater than today after the Middle Miocene Climate Transition ( 14 Ma). ODP Site 806 bottom waters cooled and freshened as the Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient increased, and climate cooled through the Pliocene, prior to the Plio-Pleistocene glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere. The records indicate a decoupling of deep water temperatures and global ice volume, demonstrating the importance of thresholds in the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the processes responsible for Earth's climate transition from an ``El Ni{\~n}o--like state'' during the warm early Pliocene into a modern-like ``La Ni{\~n}a--dominated state'' currently challenges the scientific community. Recently, the Pliocene climate switch has been linked to oceanic thermocline shoaling at ∼3 million years ago along with Earth's final transition into a bipolar icehouse world. Here we present Pliocene proxy data and climate model results, which suggest an earlier timing of the Pliocene climate switch and a different chain of forcing mechanisms. We show that the increase in North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation between 4.8 and 4.0 million years ago, initiated by the progressive closure of the Central American Seaway, triggered overall shoaling of the tropical thermocline. This preconditioned the turnaround from a warm eastern equatorial Pacific to the modern equatorial cold tongue state about 1 million years earlier than previously assumed. Since ∼3.6--3.5 million years ago, the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation resulted in a strengthening of the trade winds, thereby amplifying upwelling and biogenic productivity at low latitudes.},

The records document that the initiation of large-scale glaciation in the circum Atlantic region occurred stepwise between 3.5 and 2.4 Ma, with Greenland leading the other areas. The first major pulse of IRD occurs at 3.3 Ma suggesting a distinct expansion of the Greenland ice sheet. Progressive increases in IRD occur from 3.0 Ma, with a synchronous ice sheet development between the Greenland, Scandinavian and North American regions starting around 2.72--2.75 Ma. The regional records of IRD correspond to major trends in the oxygen isotope record, suggesting a tight connection between the record of global ice volume and evidence for expanding glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere.

	abstract = {Records of benthic foraminifera from North Atlantic DSDP Site 607 and Hole 610A indicate changes in deep water conditions through the middle to late Pliocene (3.15 to 2.85 Ma). Quantitative analyses of modern associations in the North Atlantic indicate that seven species, Fontbotia wuellerstorfi, Cibicidoides kullenbergi, Uvigerina peregrina, Nuttallides umboniferus, Melonis pompilioides, Globocassidulina subglobosa and Epistominella exigua are useful for paleoenvironmental interpretation. The western North Atlantic basin (Site 607) was occupied by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) until {\textasciitilde}2.88 Ma. At that time, N. umboniferus increased, indicating an influx of Southern Ocean Water (SOW). The eastern North Atlantic basin (Hole 610A) was occupied by a relatively warm water mass, possibly Northeastern Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW), through {\textasciitilde}2.94 Ma when SOW more strongly influenced the site. These interpretations are consistent with benthic δ18O and δ13C records from 607 and 610A (Raymo et al., 1992). The results presented in this paper suggest that the North Atlantic was strongly influenced by northern component deep water circulation until 2.90--2.95 Ma. After that there was a transition toward a glacially driven North Atlantic circulation more strongly influenced by SOW associated with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The circulation change follows the last significant SST and atmospheric warming prior to {\textasciitilde}2.6 Ma.},

	abstract = {Late Pliocene deep Atlantic δ13C data have been interpreted as evidence for enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) compared to the present, but this hypothesis is not supported by the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP). Here, we adopt a new approach to assess variability in deep ocean circulation based on paired stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) of benthic foraminifera, both (semi)conservative water mass tracers. Assuming that deep Atlantic benthic δ13C‐δ18O variability is predominantly driven by mixing, we extrapolate the δ13C‐δ18O data outside the sampled range to identify the end‐members. At least three end‐members are needed to explain the spatial δ13C‐δ18O variability in the deep North Atlantic Ocean: two Northern Component Water (NCW) and one Southern Component Water (SCW) water masses. We use a ternary mixing model to quantify the mixing proportions between SCW and NCW in the deep Atlantic Ocean. Our analysis includes new data from Ocean Drilling Program Sites 959 and 662 in the eastern equatorial Atlantic and suggests that the AMOC cell was deeper during the M2 glacial than during late Pliocene interglacials. Moreover, we identify a new cold and well‐ventilated water mass that was geographically restricted to the southeast Atlantic Ocean between 3.6 and 2.7 Ma and did not contribute significantly to the δ13C‐δ18O variability of the rest of the basin. This high‐δ13C high‐δ18O water mass has led to the misconception of a reduced latitudinal δ13C gradient. Our analyses show that the late Pliocene δ13C gradient between NCW and SCW was similar to the present‐day value of 1.1‰.},

This phenomenon, known as the Meridional Mode (MM), is shown to be intrinsic to the thermodynamic coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. The MM effectively acts as a conduit through which the extratropical atmosphere influences ENSO. Modeling results further suggest that the MM plays a vital role in the seasonal phase-locking behavior of ENSO. The findings provide a new perspective for understanding the important role of thermodynamic ocean-atmosphere feedback in ENSO and may have profound implications for ENSO prediction, particularly the unresolved issue of the spring predictability barrier.},

@article{rippertAlternatingInfluenceNorthern2017,
	abstract = {The eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) is a key area to understand past oceanic processes that control atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Many studies argue for higher nutrient concentrations by enhanced nutrient transfer via Southern Ocean Intermediate Water (SOIW) to the low-latitude Pacific during glacials. Recent studies, however, argue against SOIW as the primary nutrient source, at least during early Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS 2), as proxy data indicate that nutrients are better utilized in the Southern Ocean under glacial conditions. New results from the subarctic Pacific suggest that enhanced convection of nutrient-rich Glacial North Pacific Intermediate Water (GNPIW) contributes to changes in nutrient concentrations in equatorial subthermocline water masses during MIS 2. However, the interplay between SOIW versus GNPIW and its influence on the nutrient distribution in the EEP spanning more than one glacial cycle are still not understood. We present a carbon isotope (δ13C) record of subthermocline waters derived from deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globorotaloides hexagonus in the EEP, which is compared with published δ13C records around the Pacific. Results indicate enhanced influence of GNPIW during MIS 6 and MIS 2 compared to today with largest contributions of northern-sourced intermediate waters during glacial maxima. These observations suggest a mechanistic link between relative contributions of northern and southern intermediate waters and past EEP nutrient concentrations. A switch from increased GNPIW (decreased SOIW) to diminished GNPIW (enhanced SOIW) influence on equatorial subthermocline waters is recognized during glacial terminations and marks changes to modern-like conditions in nutrient concentrations and biological productivity in the EEP.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews some of the main advances in our understanding of human evolution over the last 1 million years, presenting a holistic overview of a field defined by interdisciplinary approaches to studying the origins of our species. We begin by briefly summarizing the climatic context across the Old World for the last 1 million years before directly addressing the fossil and archaeological records. The main themes in this work explore (i) recent discoveries in the fossil record over the last 15 years, such as Homo naledi and Homo floresiensis; (ii) the implications of palaeogenetics for understanding the evolutionary history of, and relationships between, Neanderthals, Denisovans and Homo sapiens; (iii) the interplay between physiology and metabolic demand, landscape use, and behavioural adaptations in the evolution of morphological and behavioural innovation; and (iv) recent advances in archaeological understanding for the behavioural record, in particular that of the Neanderthals. This paper seeks to provide a broad‐scale, holistic perspective of our current understanding of human evolution for the last 1 Ma, providing a reference point for researchers that can be built upon as new discoveries continue to develop the landscapes of human evolution.},

	abstract = {Benthic foraminiferal stable carbon isotope records from the South Atlantic show significant declines toward more ``Pacific-like'' values at ∼7 and ∼2.7 Ma, and it has been posited that these shifts may mark steps toward increased CO2 sequestration in the deep Southern Ocean as climate cooled over the late Neogene. We generated new stable isotope records from abyssal subantarctic Pacific cores MV0502-4JC and ELT 25-11. The record from MV0502-4JC suggests that the Southern Ocean remained well mixed and free of vertical or interbasinal δ13C gradients following the late Miocene carbon shift (LMCS). According to the records from MV0502-4JC and ELT 25-11, however, cold, low δ13C bottom waters developed in the Southern Ocean in the late Pliocene and persisted until ∼1.7 Ma. These new data suggest that while conditions in the abyssal Southern Ocean following the LMCS were comparable to the present day, sequestration of respired CO2 may have increased in the deepest parts of the Southern Ocean during the late Pliocene, a critical period for the growth and establishment of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.},

	abstract = {Geochemical profiles from the North Atlantic Ocean suggest that the vertical δ13C structure of the water column at intermediate depths did not change significantly between glacial and interglacial time over much of the Pleistocene, despite large changes in ice volume and iceberg delivery from nearby landmasses. The most anomalous δ13C profiles are from the extreme interglaciations of the late Pleistocene. This compilation of data suggests that, unlike today (an extreme interglaciation), the two primary sources of northern deep water, Norwegian-Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea/subpolar North Atlantic, had different characteristic δ13C values over most of the Pleistocene. We speculate that the current open sea ice conditions in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea are a relatively rare occurrence and that the high-δ13C deep water that forms in this region today is geologically unusual. If northern source deep waters can have highly variable δ13C, then this likelihood must be considered when inferring past circulation changes from benthic δ13C records.},

@article{hodellOnsetHudsonStrait2008,
	abstract = {Heinrich events are well documented for the last glaciation, but little is known about their occurrence in older glacial periods of the Pleistocene. Here we report scanning XRF and bulk carbonate δ18O results from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1308 (reoccupation of Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 609) that are used to develop proxy records of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) for the last ∼1.4 Ma. Ca/Sr is used as an indicator of IRD layers that are rich in detrital carbonate (i.e., Heinrich layers), whereas Si/Sr reflects layers that are poor in biogenic carbonate and relatively rich in detrital silicate minerals. A pronounced change occurred in the composition and frequency of IRD at ∼640 ka during marine isotope stage (MIS) 16, coinciding with the end of the middle Pleistocene transition. At this time, ``Hudson Strait'' Heinrich layers suddenly appeared in the sedimentary record of Site U1308, and the dominant period of the Si/Sr proxy shifted from 41 ka prior to 640 ka to 100 ka afterward. The onset of Heinrich layers during MIS 16 represents either the initiation of surging of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) off Hudson Strait or the first time icebergs produced by this process survived the transport to Site U1308. We speculate that ice volume (i.e., thickness) and duration surpassed a critical threshold during MIS 16 and activated the dynamical processes responsible for LIS instability in the region of Hudson Strait. We also observe a strong coupling between IRD proxies and benthic δ13C variation at Site U1308 throughout the Pleistocene, supporting a link between iceberg discharge and weakening of thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {The two main constituent water masses of the deep North Atlantic Ocean-North Atlantic Deep Water at the bottom and Labrador Sea Water at an intermediate level-are currently formed in the Nordic seas and the Labrador Sea, respectively. The rate of formation of these two water masses tightly governs the strength of the global ocean circulation and the associated heat transport across the North Atlantic Ocean. Numerical simulations have suggested a possible shut-down of Labrador Sea Water formation as a consequence of global warming. Here we use micropalaeontological data and stable isotope measurements in both planktonic and benthic foraminifera from deep Labrador Sea cores to investigate the density structure of the water column during the last interglacial period, which was thought to be about 2 degrees C warmer than present. Our results indicate that today's stratification between Labrador Sea Water and North Atlantic Deep Water never developed during the last interglacial period. Instead, a buoyant surface layer was present above a single water mass originating from the Nordic seas. Thus the present situation, with an active site of intermediate-water formation in the Labrador Sea, which settled some 7,000 years ago, has no analogue throughout the last climate cycle.},

Here we present high-resolution rock magnetic records during the period from 2.1 to 2.75 Ma after intensification of NHG, reconstructed from the subpolar North Atlantic. Although the establishment of the middle Pliocene chronology of North Atlantic sediments is often a serious problem, we overcame it based on findings concerning the properties of magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma radiation. Reconstructed rock magnetic records indicate that millennial-scale iceberg surges were dominant features in the early glacial periods. Additionally, the millennial-scale iceberg surges occurred within glacial stages during intervals when ratios of global oxygen isotope stack from benthic foraminifera (LR04 δ18O stack) surpassed approximately 3.5‰. These are comparable to the climatic and environmental changes in Pleistocene glacial periods as represented by last glacial Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, suggesting that continental ice sheets have oscillated and calved icebergs in a similar manner since intensification of NHG.},

However, such seawater δ18O records are also influenced by regional hydrographic signals (i.e., salinity) and changes in deep-ocean circulation across the MPT, making it difficult to isolate the timing and magnitude of the global ice volume change. To explore regional and global patterns in seawater δ18O records, we reconstruct seawater δ18O from coupled Mg/Ca and δ18O analyses of Uvigerina spp. at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1208 in the North Pacific Ocean. Comparison of individual seawater δ18O records suggests that deep-ocean circulation reorganized and the formation properties (i.e., salinity) of deep-ocean water masses changed at ca. 900 ka, likely related to the transition to marine-based ice sheets in Antarctica. We also find that an increase in ice volume likely accompanied the shift in glacial-interglacial periodicity observed in benthic carbonate δ18O across the MPT, with increases in ice volume observed during Marine Isotope Stages 22 and 16.},

              What causes the pattern of sea surface temperature change that is seen in the North Atlantic Ocean? This naturally occurring quasi-cyclical variation, known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), affects weather and climate. Some have suggested that the AMO is a consequence of variable large-scale ocean circulation. Clement
              et al.
              suggest otherwise. They find that the pattern of AMO variability can be produced in a model that does not include ocean circulation changes, but only the effects of changes in air temperatures and winds.

          , 
            The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a major mode of climate variability with important societal impacts. Most previous explanations identify the driver of the AMO as the ocean circulation, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we show that the main features of the observed AMO are reproduced in models where the ocean heat transport is prescribed and thus cannot be the driver. Allowing the ocean circulation to interact with the atmosphere does not significantly alter the characteristics of the AMO in the current generation of climate models. These results suggest that the AMO is the response to stochastic forcing from the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, with thermal coupling playing a role in the tropics. In this view, the AMOC and other ocean circulation changes would be largely a response to, not a cause of, the AMO.},

	abstract = {Starting from the assumption that the atmosphere is the primary source of variability internal to the midlatitude atmosphere--ocean system on intraseasonal to interannual timescales, the authors construct a simple stochastically forced, one-dimensional, linear, coupled energy balance model. The coupled system is then dissected into partially coupled and uncoupled systems in order to quantify the effects of coupling. The simplicity of the model allows for analytic evaluation of many quantities of interest, including power spectra, total variance, lag covariance between atmosphere and ocean, and surface flux spectra. The model predicts that coupling between the atmosphere and ocean in the midlatitudes will enhance the variance in both media and will decrease the energy flux between the atmosphere and the ocean. The model also demonstrates that specification of historical midlatitude sea surface temperature anomalies as a boundary condition for an atmospheric model will not generally lead to a correct simulation of low-frequency atmospheric thermal variance.},

Results from DSDP and ODP Sites 552A, 610A, 607, 658A, 659A, 661A and 704 for the period Ma reveal both depth and latitudinal gradients of mean Mg/Ca values. Shallower sites (552A, 610A and 607) have higher mean Mg/Ca ratios (10.3, 9.7, 10.1 mmol/mol) than deeper sites (661A, 6.3 mmol/ mol), and high latitude North Atlantic sites (552A, 610 and 607) have higher Mg/Ca ratios than low latitude (658A: 9.8 mmol/ mol, 659A: 7.7 mmol/mol, 661A: 6.3 mmol/mol) and Southern Ocean (704: 8.0 mmol/mol) sites.

@article{kniesEffectEarlyPliocene2014,
	abstract = {Despite the undisputed role of the Arctic Ocean in the modern and Pliocene climate system, the Arctic has only recently attracted public awareness that ongoing, fundamental change in the Arctic cryosphere could be a response to global warming. Clarification of the Arctic's role in global climate during the Pliocene is, however, largely hampered by equivocal stratigraphic constraints. From a well-dated Pliocene sequence from the Yermak Plateau, off NW Spitsbergen, we present sedimentological and geochemical data indicating that 4 million years ago terrigenous sediment supply and sources changed abruptly in response to a regional tectonic uplift event. We argue that this event together with contemporary uplift and tilting along the northwestern European continental margin preconditioned the landmasses for glacial ice build-up during intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (INHG). Our data further suggest that the final deepening/widening of the Arctic--Atlantic gateway, the Fram Strait, between 6.5 and 5 Ma gradually caused increased deep-water mass exchange which, in turn, likely contributed to the intensification of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Coupled to the North Atlantic warm pool as a regional moisture source, declining atmospheric CO2 levels and other feedback mechanisms during the Pliocene, the regional tectonic activities in the high northern latitudes caused decreased summer ablation and thus allowed the initial build-up of glacial ice both in Scandinavia, and the sub-aerially exposed Svalbard/Barents Sea, culminating in the first large-scale coastline-shelf edge glaciations at ∼2.75 Ma ago.},

Although modelling, outcrop and proxy records suggest volcanic carbon release occurred, it has not yet been possible to identify the PETM trigger, or if multiple reservoirs of carbon were involved. Here we report elevated levels of mercury relative to organic carbon---a proxy for volcanism---directly preceding and within the early PETM from two North Sea sedimentary cores, signifying pulsed volcanism from the North Atlantic Igneous Province likely provided the trigger and subsequently sustained elevated CO2. However, the PETM onset coincides with a mercury low, suggesting at least one other carbon reservoir released significant greenhouse gases in response to initial warming. Our results support the existence of `tipping points' in the Earth system, which can trigger release of additional carbon reservoirs and drive Earth's climate into a hotter state.},

An increase in explosive volcanism in the Kamchatka--Kurile and Aleutian arcs occurred at this same time, suggesting a link between volcanism and glaciation. Sediments recovered by piston-coring techniques during ODP Leg 145 provide a unique opportunity to undertake a detailed test of this possibility. Here we use volcanic glass as a proxy for explosive volcanism and ice-rafted debris (IRD) as a proxy for glaciation. The MAR of both glass and IRD increase markedly at 2.65Ma. Further, the flux of the volcanic glass increased just prior to the flux of ice-rafted material, suggesting that the cooling resulting from explosive volcanic eruptions may have been the ultimate trigger for the mid-Pliocene glacial intensification.},

@article{loweTephrochronologyItsApplication2011,
	abstract = {Tephrochronology (from tephra, Gk `ashes') is a unique stratigraphic method for linking, dating, and synchronizing geological, palaeoenvironmental, or archaeological sequences or events. As well as utilizing the Law of Superposition, tephrochronology in practise requires tephra deposits to be characterized (or `fingerprinted') using physical properties evident in the field together with those obtained from laboratory analyses. Such analyses include mineralogical examination (petrography) or geochemical analysis of glass shards or crystals using an electron microprobe or other analytical tools including laser-ablation-based mass spectrometry or the ion microprobe. The palaeoenvironmental or archaeological context in which a tephra occurs may also be useful for correlational purposes. Tephrochronology provides greatest utility when a numerical age obtained for a tephra or cryptotephra is transferrable from one site to another using stratigraphy and by comparing and matching inherent compositional features of the deposits with a high degree of likelihood. Used this way, tephrochronology is an age-equivalent dating method that provides an exceptionally precise volcanic-event stratigraphy. Such age transfers are valid because the primary tephra deposits from an eruption essentially have the same short-lived age everywhere they occur, forming isochrons very soon after the eruption (normally within a year). As well as providing isochrons for palaeoenvironmental and archaeological reconstructions, tephras through their geochemical analysis allow insight into volcanic and magmatic processes, and provide a comprehensive record of explosive volcanism and recurrence rates in the Quaternary (or earlier) that can be used to establish time--space relationships of relevance to volcanic hazard analysis. The basis and application of tephrochronology as a central stratigraphic and geochronological tool for Quaternary studies are presented and discussed in this review. Topics covered include principles of tephrochronology, defining isochrons, tephra nomenclature, mapping and correlating tephras from proximal to distal locations at metre- through to sub-millimetre-scale, cryptotephras, mineralogical and geochemical fingerprinting methods, numerical and statistical correlation techniques, and developments and applications in dating including the use of flexible depositional age-modelling techniques based on Bayesian statistics. Along with reference to wide-ranging examples and the identification of important recent advances in tephrochronology, such as the development of new geo-analytical approaches that enable individual small glass shards to be analysed near-routinely for major, trace, and rare-earth elements, potential problems such as miscorrelation, erroneous-age transfer, and tephra reworking and taphonomy (especially relating to cryptotephras) are also examined. Some of the challenges for future tephrochronological studies include refining geochemical analytical methods further, improving understanding of cryptotephra distribution and preservation patterns, improving age modelling including via new or enhanced radiometric or incremental techniques and Bayesian-derived models, evaluating and quantifying uncertainty in tephrochronology to a greater degree than at present, constructing comprehensive regional databases, and integrating tephrochronology with spatially referenced environmental and archaeometric data into 3-D reconstructions using GIS and geostatistics.},

@article{jellinekDidMeltingGlaciers2004,
	abstract = {A comparison of time series of basaltic and silicic eruptions in eastern California over the last 400 kyr with the contemporaneous global record of glaciation suggests that this volcanism is influenced by the growth and retreat of glaciers occurring over periods of about 40 kyr. Statistically significant cross correlations between changes in eruption frequency and the first derivative of the glacial time series imply that the temporal pattern of volcanism is influenced by the rate of change in ice volume. Moreover, calculated time lags for the effects of glacial unloading on silicic and basaltic volcanism are distinct and are 3.2 $\pm$ 4.2 kyr and 11.2 $\pm$ 2.3 kyr, respectively. A theoretical model is developed to investigate whether the increases in eruption frequency following periods of glacial unloading are a response ultimately controlled by the dynamics of dike formation. Applying results from the time series analysis leads, in turn, to estimates for the critical magma chamber overpressure required for eruption as well as constraints on the effective viscosity of the wall rocks governing dike propagation.},

@article{geirsdottirGrowthIntermittentIce1994,
	abstract = {Deep-sea paleoclimatic records show that the Quaternary climate around Iceland was, and probably still is, very sensitive to rapid shifts in North Atlantic oceanic circulation. Studies of several key sections in Iceland indicate that similar oscillations are reflected in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene terrestrial stratigraphy. Correlations between six rock sequences in western, northern, eastern, and southern Iceland show a fairly distinct trend during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition indicating the progressive growth of an ice sheet from southeast toward the north and west. The correlations are based on K/Ar dates and paleomagnetic studies. A total of 11 glacial horizons are recorded in a stratigraphic column from eastern Iceland extending back 6.5 myr. In western Iceland, 7 glacial horizons are preserved in a rock section dated from 7.0 to 1.8 myr, and in northern Iceland 14 glacial horizons are identified in a section that extends back to 9.0 myr. Well over 20 glacial horizons have been identified in the stratigraphic column in Iceland. Full-scale glacial-interglacial cyclicity with regional ice cover is indicated at approximately 2.6 myr. A further amplification leading to islandwide glaciations is identified at 2.2-2.1 myr. These results show that changes in the ice cover in Iceland correlate with the deep-sea oxygen isotope records from benthic and planktonic foraminifera as well as IRD studies from the North Atlantic.},

The smoothed age distribution shows peaks at 10, 100, 185, 320, and 690 kyr, corresponding to interglacial cycles 1, 5, 7, 9, and 17. This implies that volcanism was modulated by changes in climate, although the processes that link the two are not well understood. Several factors, including transient loads imposed across rugged topography by ice and water and changes in groundwater regime, may provide the link. Although climatic modulation of volcanism is generally tied to changes in sea level, these data indicate that even volcanoes far from the coast can be affected by climatic change.},

	abstract = {Tephra (volcanic ash) deposits are important isochronous markers for correlating marine sediments or events recorded in marine sediment cores. However, the active tectonics that are commonly associated with volcanic activity at plate tectonicboundaries also drive large-scale deformation, leading to steep and variable local and regional bathymetry (e.g., ridges, basins and canyons systems). This complex bathymetry influences gravity-flow behaviour and paths, which can rework and redeposit tephras, resulting in stratigraphic complexities. Such as, the mis-identification of primary versus reworked tephra deposits, and in turn lead to the development of inaccurate chronostratigraphies. Here we present 36 tephra deposits from 21 shallow marine sediment cores that traverse the length of the southern and central margin of eastern North Island, New Zealand. Using major and trace element geochemical compositions for glass shards from the tephras, we correlate these deposits to three major rhyolitic eruptions from the Taup{\=o} Volcanic Zone (TVZ) approximately 200 km west, including; Taup{\=o} (1718 cal yrs. BP), Kaharoa (636 cal yrs. BP), and Kawakawa/Oruanui (KOT; 25.4 ka). Based on their morphology, depositional character and inferred emplacement mechanisms, the tephra deposits are grouped into four lithofacies types; (1) primary deposits, (2) volcaniclastic-rich turbidites, (3) blebs/pods of volcaniclastic-rich material, and (4) complex deposits. Primary deposits form syn-eruptively through airfall onto the ocean surface, settling over hours to days through the water column under diffuse vertical gravity currents. Volcaniclastic-rich turbidites are formed through secondary redeposition and entrainment by post-eruptive turbidity currents, while blebs/pods of material are interpreted to have formed by erosion and/or bioturbation. Complex deposits form through the interaction of all these mechanisms producing an overthickened array of primary and redeposited units within a single facies. Herein, we argue that redeposited units of volcaniclastic-rich turbidites or small blebs/pods can be used as tentative chronological markers if the geochemical composition of the glass shards have a homogeneous signature, i.e. a single eruptive source. Where the glass shards in redeposited units have mixed geochemical compositions, and are not stratigraphically associated with a primary deposit source, they cannot be used as chronological marker horizons. This emphasises the need for accurate and rigorous data reduction without overlooking the importance of data points that are statistical outliers. We also show that the highest preservation of tephra deposits is found in semi-confined isolated basin settings, including a wide range of deposit types. Due to erosive sediment flows that bypass through submarine distributary systems, these major sediment dispersal pathways preserve few volcaniclastic deposits. Our findings have important implications not only for identifying primary or redeposited characteristics in marine tephras for building accurate chronostratigraphies, but also as a guide geomorphic sub-environments with the best preservation of tephras in marine sedimentary systems.},

@article{nakayamaDepositionalProcessesPrimary1997,
	abstract = {A change from primary to reworked volcaniclastic deposits in the Lower Pliocene Ohta tephra bed has been identified, using facies analysis. The Ohta tephra bed is a widespread marker-tephra, distributed over a distance of more than 130 km. The source volcano of this tephra is inferred to lie 50 to 100 km north of the most proximal Ohta tephra bed. The Ohta tephra bed shows a change in volcaniclastic facies in distal areas. Eight sedimentary facies are recognized. These are interpreted as pyroclastic fall, pyroclastic flow, and reworked (mudflow, flood flow, channel fill, swamp or backswamp, lacustrine and ephemeral pond) deposits. In underlying and overlying non-volcaniclastic beds, four sedimentary facies are recognized, indicating a fluvio (-lacustrine) depositional system on an alluvial plain. From the successions of volcaniclastic sedimentary facies, deposition of the Ohta tephra bed can be divided into stages I to VI. Each depositional stage is intimately related to volcanic activity. Stage I is the first eruption, during which only the northern part of the study area was covered with fallout ash. The second eruption stage of stage II involved fallout ash distributed over all the study area. These two fallout ash beds are derived from precursor eruptions. Stage III reflects a period of volcanic quiescence and development of widespread lacustrine conditions. The fallout ash may have destroyed vegetation, and prompted greater discharge to form the large lacustrine deposits of stage III. A pyroclastic flow stage in stage IV is associated with an explosive eruption, and resulted in pyroclastic flow deposits reaching the northern part of the study area. Stage V is characterized by mudflow deposits. Widespread mudflow deposits also originated from high water and clastics discharge on the unvegetated surface. Mudflows extend more than 180 km from the source volcano. Abundant supply of volcaniclastic material and high water and clastic discharge enhanced a rapid progradation of alluvial plains. Final reworking occurred during stage VI, when volcaniclastic sediments were deposited from a fluvio-lacustrine system. The reworking system comprises initial mudflows, followed by a normal fluvial system (normal stream flow). The mudflow deposits of stage V are traceable with roughly constant thickness, but the volcaniclastic content of the deposits decreases in distal areas. The fluvial system deposits of stage VI are thicker and have less abundant volcaniclastics in distal areas. Fluvial systems were braided streams promoted by volcanic eruption, while they were meandering streams during the pre-eruption period. Some eruption-induced braided streams remained for a while following the cessation of volcanic activity.},

	abstract = {Electron-microprobe analyses of glass shards from volcanic ash in Pliocene and Pleistocene deep-sea sediments in the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin demonstrate that most of the tephra layers correlate with tephra layers known on land in the Turkana Basin of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. Previous correlations are reviewed, and new correlations proposed. Together these data provide correlations between the deep-sea cores, and to the land-based sections at eight levels ranging in age from about 4 to 0.7 Ma. Specifically, we correlate the Moiti Tuff (???4.1 Ma) with a tephra layer at 188.6 m depth in DSDP hole 231 and with a tephra layer at 150 m depth in DSDP hole 241, the Wargolo Tuff with a tephra layer at 179.7 m in DSDP Hole 231 and with a tephra layer at 155.3 m depth in DSDP Hole 232, the Lomogol Tuff (defined here) with a tephra layer at 165 m in DSDP Hole 232A, the Lokochot Tuff with a tephra layer at 140.1 m depth in DSDP Hole 232, the Tulu Bor Tuff with a tephra layer at 160.8 m depth in DSDP Hole 231, the Kokiselei Tuff with a tephra layer at 120 m depth in DSDP Hole 231 and with a tephra layer at 90.3 m depth in DSDP Hole 232, the Silbo Tuff (0.74 Ma) with a tephra layer at 35.5 m depth in DSDP Hole 231 and possibly with a tephra layer at 10.9 m depth in DSDP Hole 241. We also present analyses of other tephra from the deep sea cores for which correlative units on land are not yet known. The correlated tephra layers provide eight chronostratigraphic horizons that make it possible to temporally correlate paleoecological and paleoclimatic data between the terrestrial and deep-sea sites. Such correlations may make it possible to interpret faunal evolution in the Lake Turkana basin and other sites in East Africa within a broader regional or global paleoclimatic context. ?? 1992.},

	abstract = {The study of the chemical stability of vitreous material in aqueous media is well-established. There has to date been little consideration of the implications of variations in the chemical durability of tephra in Quaternary tephrochronology. Chemical alteration can take the form of cationic leaching from the matrix, or complete destruction of the silica network, either of which could constrain the ability to chemically identify distal tephra. Here we apply established models of vitreous durability to the published chemical analyses of a large number of Icelandic tephras in order to predict their relative durabilities under equivalent conditions. This suggests that some important tephras have relatively poor chemical stability, and that rhyolitic tephras are, in general, more stable than basaltic. We conclude that tephras should be expected to show predictable differential chemical stability in the post-depositional environment. Copyright {\copyright} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{wilsonDynamicIntermediateOcean2014,
	abstract = {The last deglaciation was characterized by a series of millennial-scale climate events that have been linked to deep ocean variability. While often implied in interpretations, few direct constraints exist on circulation changes at mid-depths. Here we provide new constraints on the variability of deglacial mid-depth circulation using combined radiocarbon and neodymium isotopes in 24 North Atlantic deep-sea corals. Their aragonite skeletons have been dated by uranium-series, providing absolute ages and the resolution to record centennial-scale changes, while transects spanning the lifetime of a single coral allow subcentennial tracer reconstruction. Our results reveal that rapid fluctuations of water mass sourcing and radiocarbon affected the mid-depth water column (1.7--2.5 km) on timescales of less than 100 years during the latter half of Heinrich Stadial 1. The neodymium isotopic variability ({\`A}14.5 to {\`A}11.0) ranges from the composition of the modern northern-sourced waters towards more radiogenic compositions, suggesting the presence of a greater southern-sourced component at some times. However, in detail, simple two-component mixing between well-ventilated northern-sourced and radiocarbon-depleted southern-sourced water masses cannot explain all our data. Instead, corals from {\textasciitilde}15.0 ka and {\textasciitilde}15.8 ka may record variability between southern-sourced intermediate waters and radiocarbon-depleted northern-sourced waters, unless there was a major shift in the neodymium isotopic composition of the northern end-member. In order to explain the rapid shift towards the most depleted radiocarbon values at {\textasciitilde}15.4 ka, we suggest a different mixing scenario involving either radiocarbon-depleted deep water from the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas or a southern-sourced deep water mass. Since these mid-depth changes preceded the Bolling-Allerod warming and were apparently unaccompanied by changes in the deep Atlantic, they may indicate an important role for the intermediate ocean in the early deglacial climate evolution.},

@article{labeyrieChangesVerticalStructure1992,
	abstract = {The distribution of planktic foraminiferal δ18O over the North Atlantic Ocean has been interpreted by Duplessy et al. (1991, 1992) in terms of the distribution of surface water salinity during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Younger Dryas (YD). We present here the implications of this surface salinity distribution for changes in deep convection during these periods. Temperature/salinity/density diagrams of the water column have been constructed using the plancktic and benthic foraminifera δ18O values together with sea surface temperature estimates obtained by using micropaleontological transfer functions. The precision of these reconstructions is limited by the remaining uncertainties in the two basic assumptions upon which the methods are based: --- the sea surface temperature reconstruction by CLIMAP are valid within the statistical uncertainties; --- the water salinity/δ18O relationship is well constrained for surface and intermediate ocean waters. A significant difference between the modern and the reconstructed glacial water structure is observed. During the LGM, the modern relatively warm and salty Norwegian Sea surface water and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) were replaced by low salinity surface water in the northern Atlantic Ocean and the Norwegian Sea and cold deep water (0--1$\,^{\circ}$C). However, surface water salinity in the central North Atlantic Ocean (52--54$\,^{\circ}$N., 25--40$\,^{\circ}$W.) was sufficiently high to permit deep water convection as a source of North Atlantic intermediate and deep waters. Open ocean convection at the northern limit of the subtropical surface waters (around 40$\,^{\circ}$N.) may have contributed to the ventilation of the intermediate waters. The waters deeper than 2000 m were the result of mixing between poorly-oxygenated southern waters and well-ventilated North Atlantic deep waters. A similar reconstruction for the cold YD period indicates that the modern type of circulation, with warm and ventilated NADW, was largely in operation and that the hydrologic pattern was different from that prevailing during the LGM.},

@article{piotrowskiOscillatingGlacialNorthern2008,
	abstract = {While ocean circulation is driven by the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic and the Circum-Antarctic, the role of southern-sourced deep water formation in climate change is poorly understood. Here we address the balance of northern- and southern-sourced waters in the South Atlantic through the last glacial period using neodymium isotope ratios of authigenic ferromanganese oxides in thirteen deep sea cores from throughout the South Atlantic. The data indicate that northern-sourced water did not reach the Southern Ocean during the late glacial, and was replaced by southern-derived intermediate and deep waters. The high-resolution neodymium isotope record ({\textasciitilde}300 yr sample spacing) from two spliced deep Cape Basin sites indicates that over the last glacial period northern-sourced water mass export to the Southern Ocean was stronger during the major Greenland millennial warming intervals (and Southern Hemisphere cool periods), and particularly during the major interstadials 8, 12, and 14. Northern-sourced water mass export was weaker during Greenland stadials and reached minima during Heinrich Events. The benthic foraminiferal carbon isotopes in the same Cape Basin core reflect a partial control by Southern Hemisphere climate changes and indicate that deep water formation and ventilation occurred in the Southern Ocean during major Greenland cooling intervals (stadials). Together, neodymium isotopes and benthic carbon isotopes provide new information about water mass sourcing and circulation in deep Southern Ocean waters during rapid glacial climate changes. Combining carbon and neodymium isotopes can be used to monitor the relative proportion of northern- and southern-sourced waters in the Cape Basin to gain insight into the processes which control the carbon isotopic composition of deep waters. In this study we show that deep water formation and circulation was more important than biological productivity and nutrient regeneration changes for controlling the carbon isotope chemistry of Antarctic Bottom Water during millennial-scale glacial climate cycles. This observation also lends support to the hypothesis that ocean circulation is linked to interhemispheric climate changes on short timescales, and that ventilation in the glacial ocean rapidly switched between the northern and Southern Hemisphere on millennial timescales.},

@article{piotrowskiReconstructingDeglacialNorth2012,
	abstract = {During the last few decades, neodymium isotopes have been increasingly used as a paleoceanographic and paleoclimate proxy on million-year through millennial time-scales. The widespread use of the Nd isotope proxy depends on whether the Nd isotopic composition of past seawater can be reliably extracted from authigenic sediment phases. Here we show evidence that planktonic foraminifera with authigenic coatings preserve a deep water Nd isotopic signature and thus can be used to reconstruct past deep water Nd isotopes. Applying this method downcore on South Atlantic Deep Cape Basin core TNO57-21 (41.1$\,^{\circ}$S, 7.9$\,^{\circ}$E, 4981m), the Nd isotopic composition of the planktonic foraminiferal Fe--Mn oxide coatings is identical with and confirms that of the reductively leached bulk sediment fraction (Piotrowski et al., 2004, Piotrowski et al., 2005, Piotrowski et al., 2008) as reflecting changes in bottom water sourcing. In the case of northeastern North Atlantic core BOFS 8K (52.5$\,^{\circ}$N 22.1$\,^{\circ}$W, 4045m), the planktonic foraminiferal Fe--Mn oxide coatings have different Nd isotopes from reductive sediment leaches. Clearly acid-reductive leaching must be tested in more detail. We observe that the Nd isotopic composition of the deep northeastern Atlantic core shifted during the deglaciation, from glacial values similar to the South Atlantic Cape Basin towards Holocene values similar to the Bermuda Rise (Roberts et al., 2010). Taken as a whole, the Nd isotope record from foraminiferal authigenic coatings suggests large-scale changes in the proportion of northern and southern deep water sources occurred throughout the Atlantic Ocean, with substantial chemical gradients at times, during the last deglaciation.},

@article{kenderNeodymiumEvidenceIncreased2018,
	abstract = {Low salinity surface water inhibits local deepwater formation in the modern North Pacific. Instead, southern-sourced Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) fills the basin, which is the product of water masses formed from cold sinking centers in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. This CDW is responsible for transporting a significant amount of global heat and dissolved carbon in the deep Pacific Ocean. The history of its flow and the broader overturning circulation are widely assumed to be sensitive to climate perturbations. However, insufficient records exist of CDW presence in the deep North Pacific with which to evaluate its evolution and role in major climate transitions of the past 23 Ma. Here we report sedimentary coatings and fish teeth neodymium isotope values---tracers for water-mass mixing---from deepwater International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1438 (4.7 km water depth) in the Philippine Sea, northwest Pacific Ocean. Our results indicate the water mass shifted from a North Pacific source in the early Miocene to a southern source by 14 Ma. Within the age model and temporal constraints, this major reorganization of North Pacific water mass structure may have coincided with ice sheet build up on Antarctica and is most consistent with an increased northward flux of CDW due to enhanced sinking of cold water forced by Antarctic cooling. The northward extent of this flux may have remained relatively constant during much of the past 14 Ma.},

@article{riesselmanCarbonNeodymiumIsotopic2012,
	abstract = {Earth's future climate may resemble the mid-Piacenzian Age of the Pliocene, a time when global temperatures were sustained within the range predicted for the coming century. Surface and deep water temperature reconstructions and coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model simulations by the USGS PRISM (Pliocene Research Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping) Group identify a dramatic North Atlantic warm surface temperature anomaly in the mid-Piacenzian (3.264 - 3.025 Ma), accompanied by increased evaporation. The anomaly is detected in deep waters at 46$\,^{\circ}$S, suggesting enhanced meridional overturning circulation and more southerly penetration of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) during the PRISM interval. However deep water temperature proxies are not diagnostic of water mass and some coupled model simulations predict transient decreases in NADW production in the 21st century, presenting a contrasting picture of future climate. We present a new multi-proxy investigation of Atlantic deep ocean circulation during the warm mid-Piacenzian, using δ13C of benthic foraminifera as a proxy for water mass age and the neodymium isotopic composition of fossil fish teeth (ɛNd) as a proxy for water mass source and mixing. This reconstruction utilizes both new and previously published data from DSDP and ODP cores along equatorial (Ceara Rise), southern mid-latitude (Walvis Ridge), and south Atlantic (Meteor Rise/Agulhas Ridge) depth transects. Additional end-member sites in the regions of modern north Atlantic and Southern Ocean deep water formation provide a Pliocene baseline for comparison. δ13C throughout the Atlantic basin is remarkably homogenous during the PRISM interval. δ13C values of Cibicidoides spp. and C. wuellerstorfi largely range between 0‰ and 1‰ at North Atlantic, shallow equatorial, southern mid-latitude, and south Atlantic sites with water depths from 2000-4700 m; both depth and latitudinal gradients are generally small ({\textasciitilde}0.3‰). However, equatorial Ceara Rise sites below 3500 m diverge, with δ13C values as low as -1.2‰ at {\textasciitilde}3.15 Ma. The uniquely negative δ13C values at deep Ceara rise sites suggest that, during PRISM warmth, the oldest Atlantic deep waters may have resided along the modern deep western boundary current, while younger deep water masses were concentrated to the south and east. In the modern Atlantic, the ɛNd value of southern-sourced waters is more radiogenic than that of northern-sourced waters, providing a complimentary means to characterize Pliocene water mass geometry. ɛNd values from shallow (2500 m) and deep (4700 m) Walvis Ridge sites average -10 and -11 respectively; the shallow site is somewhat more radiogenic than published coretop ɛNd (-12), suggesting enhanced Pliocene influence of southern-sourced water masses. Ongoing analytical efforts will fingerprint Piacenzian ɛNd from north and south deep water source regions and will target additional depth transect ɛNd, allowing us to investigate the possibility that "older" carbon isotopic signatures at western equatorial sites reflect entrainment of proto-NADW while "younger" signatures at southern and eastern sites reflect the influence of southern-sourced deep water.},

@article{sepulchreConsequencesShoalingCentral2014,
	abstract = {The Central American Seaway played a pivotal role in shaping global climate throughout the late Cenozoic. Recent geological surveys have provided new constraints on timing of the seaway shoaling, while neodymium isotopic (εNd) data measured on fossil teeth, debris, and ferromanganese crusts have helped define the history of water masses in the region. Here we provide the first 3-D simulations of εNd responses to the shoaling seaway. Our model suggests that a narrow and shallow seaway is sufficient to affect interoceanic circulation, that inflow/outflow balance between the Caribbean and the Antilles responds nonlinearly to sill depth, and that a seaway narrower than 400 km is consistent with an active Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the late Miocene. Simulated εNd values in the Caribbean confirm that inputs from radiogenic Pacific waters in the Caribbean decrease as the seaway shoals. Despite model limitations, a comparison between our results and εNd values recorded in the Caribbean helps constrain the depth of the Central American Seaway through time, and we infer that a depth between 50 and 200 m could have been reached 10 Ma ago.},

@article{osborneSeawaterNeodymiumLead2014,
	abstract = {The shoaling and final closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS) resulted in a major change of the global ocean circulation and has been suggested as an essential driver for strengthening of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The exact timing of CAS closure is key to interpreting its importance. Here we present a reconstruction of deep and intermediate water Nd and Pb isotope compositions obtained from fossil fish teeth and the authigenic coatings of planktonic foraminifera in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1241) and the Caribbean (ODP Sites 998, 999, and 1000) covering the final stages of CAS closure between 5.6 and 2.2 Ma. The data for the Pacific site indicate no significant Atlantic/Caribbean influence over this entire period. The Caribbean sites show a continuous trend to less radiogenic Nd isotope compositions during the Pliocene, consistent with an enhancement of Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW) inflow and a strengthening of the AMOC. Superimposed onto this long-term trend, shorter-term changes of intermediate Caribbean Nd isotope signatures approached more UNADW-like values during intervals when published reconstructions of seawater salinity suggested complete closure of the CAS. The data imply that significant deep water exchange with the Pacific essentially stopped by 7 Ma and that shallow exchange, which still occurred at least periodically until approximately 2.5 Ma, may have been linked to the strength of the AMOC but did not have any direct effect on the intermediate and deep Caribbean Nd isotope signatures through mixing with Pacific waters.},

@article{lacanNeodymiumIsotopesNew2005,
	abstract = {Continental margins are, via river sediment discharges, the major source of a number of elements to the ocean. They are also, for several reactive elements, sites of preferential removal from the water column, due to enhanced scavenging [1] [M.P. Bacon, Tracers of chemical scavenging in the ocean: Boundary effects and large-scale chemical fractionation, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., A 325 (1988) 147--160.]. They can therefore be understood as sources of elements for the ocean, sinks or both. Although exchanges of matter are suspected to occur at the continent/ocean interface [2] [P.H. Santschi, L.

Here, based on neodymium isotopic composition data obtained during the past 6 yr, we document and quantify significant neodymium exchange at ocean boundaries, in areas covering a large spectra of hydrographical, biological and geochemical characteristics : Eastern Indian Ocean, Western Equatorial Pacific, Western Tropical Pacific and Northwestern Atlantic, with neodymium removal fluxes accounting for 74$\pm$23\%, 100$\pm$38\%, 62$\pm$54\% and 84$\pm$45\% of the neodymium input fluxes, respectively. Recognition of boundary exchange and its potential globalization have important implications for (1) our understanding of margin/ocean interactions and their influence on the oceanic isotopic chemistry, and (2) geochemical cycling of reactive elements (including pollutants) at ocean margins.},

The prominent changes in air temperature recorded in the Greenland ice cores1,2 are coherent with shifts in the magnitude of the northward heat flux carried by the North Atlantic surface ocean3,4; changes in the ocean's thermohaline circulation are a key component in many explanations of this climate flickering5. Here we use stable-isotope and other sedimentological data to reveal specific oceanic reorganizations during these rapid climate-change events. Deep water was generated more or less continuously in the Nordic Seas during the latter part of the last glacial period (60 to 10 thousand years ago), but by two different mechanisms. The deep-water formation occurred by convection in the open ocean during warmer periods (interstadials). But during colder phases (stadials), a freshening of the surface ocean reduced or stopped open-ocean convection, and deep-water formation was instead driven by brine-release during sea-ice freezing. These shifting magnitudes and modes nested within the overall continuity of deep-water formation were probably important for the structuring and rapidity of the prevailing climate changes.},

	abstract = {North Atlantic climate is very sensitive to overturning in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas, overflow of deep water into the North Atlantic via the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge, and compensating northward flow of warm surface water. Physical models suggest that, in the absence of such overturning, oceanic heat transport to the Northern Hemisphere is reduced by as much as 50\%, open North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures are as much as 6 $\,^{\circ}$C lower, and the winter sea-ice limit migrates as far south as 45$\,^{\circ}$N. Although simulations of the equilibrium climate state for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) suggest the absence of GIN Seas overflow, tests of these model results have been hampered by ambiguity in sedimentary proxies. Here we present a bottom-water neodymium (Nd) isotope record from the Rockall Trough to investigate changes in the sources of circulating waters over the past 43 k.y. Today and throughout most of the Holocene, water from the GIN Seas, along with water from the North Atlantic Current (NAC) entrained during overflow, sets the bottom-water Nd isotope composition of the Rockall Trough to ∼--10. Our results suggest the persistence of this scenario back into the LGM and beyond to mid-Marine Isotope Stage 3. Periodic radiogenic excursions punctuate the record at times of meltwater events, implying either continued GIN Seas overflow without NAC entrainment, or millennial-scale interruptions in the overflow and shoaling of Southern Source Water. We conclude that overflow was at least intermittently present during the LGM, if not continuous, and that the GIN Seas have remained a source of deep water to the North Atlantic during the last glacial cycle.},

@article{bertramPlioceneDeglacialEvent2018,
	abstract = {Significantly reduced ice coverage in Greenland and West Antarctica during the warmer-than-present Pliocene could account for ∼10 m of global mean sea level rise. Any sea level increase beyond this would require contributions from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Previous studies have presented low-resolution geochemical evidence from the geological record, suggesting repeated ice advance and retreat in low-lying areas of the EAIS such as the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. However, the rates and mechanisms of retreat events are less well constrained. Here we present orbitally-resolved marine detrital sediment provenance data, paired with ice-rafted debris and productivity proxies, during three time intervals from the middle to late Pliocene at IODP Site U1361A, offshore of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. Our new data reveal that Pliocene shifts in sediment provenance were paralleled by increases in marine productivity, while the onset of such changes was marked by peaks in ice-rafted debris mass accumulation rates. The coincidence of sediment provenance and marine productivity change argues against a switch in sediment delivery between ice streams, and instead suggests that deglacial warming triggered increased rates of iceberg calving, followed by inland retreat of the ice margin. Timescales from the onset of deglaciation to an inland retreated ice margin within the Wilkes Subglacial Basin are on the order of several thousand years. This geological evidence corroborates retreat rates determined from ice sheet modeling, and a contribution of ∼3 to 4 m of equivalent sea level rise from one of the most vulnerable areas of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet during interglacial intervals throughout the middle to late Pliocene.},

	abstract = {Variations in the strength of the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation have been linked to rapid climate changes1 during the last glacial cycle through oscillations in North Atlantic Deep Water formation and northward oceanic heat flux2,3,4. The strength of the thermohaline circulation depends on the supply of warm, salty water to the North Atlantic, which, after losing heat to the atmosphere, produces the dense water masses that sink to great depths and circulate back south2. Here we analyse two Caribbean Sea sediment cores, combining Mg/Ca palaeothermometry with measurements of oxygen isotopes in foraminiferal calcite in order to reconstruct tropical Atlantic surface salinity5,6 during the last glacial cycle. We find that Caribbean salinity oscillated between saltier conditions during the cold oxygen isotope stages 2, 4 and 6, and lower salinities during the warm stages 3 and 5, covarying with the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation7. At the initiation of the B{\o}lling/Aller{\o}d warm interval, Caribbean surface salinity decreased abruptly, suggesting that the advection of salty tropical waters into the North Atlantic amplified thermohaline circulation and contributed to high-latitude warming.},

	abstract = {A constant disequilibrium technique was used to determine the composition of magnesian calcite overgrowths precipitated on pure calcite seeds from artificial seawater at 5, 25 and 40$\,^{\circ}$C. The amount of magnesium incorporated in the overgrowths at a given temperature is independent of the precipitation rate over a wide range of saturation states and is believed to correspond to a composition in true equilibrium with seawater. The distribution coefficient of magnesium, DMg2+c, in the magnesian calcite overgrowths increases almost linearly with temperature, being 0.0121 $\pm$ 0.0013 at 5$\,^{\circ}$C, 0.0172 $\pm$ 0.0022 at 25$\,^{\circ}$C, and 0.0271 $\pm$ 0.0013 at 40$\,^{\circ}$C. These values apply only to magnesian calcites precipitated from standard composition seawater, since a previous study has shown DMg2+c to be a function of the [Mg2+][Ca2+] ratio in the parent solution. Results of this study are compared with values reported previously by other workers, and with the compositional distribution of naturally occurring magnesian calcite cements and ooids found in seawater. It appears that variations in temperature are not sufficient to account for the compositional variability of naturally occurring ``inorganic'' marine magnesian calcite cements.},

@article{modestouWarmMiddleMiocene2020,
	abstract = {The middle Miocene is an important analogue for potential future warm climates. However, few independent deep ocean temperature records exist, though these are important for climate model validation and estimates of changes in ice volume. Existing records, all based on the foraminiferal Mg/Ca proxy, suggest that bottom water temperatures were 5--8$\,^{\circ}$C warmer than present. In order to improve confidence in these bottom water temperature reconstructions, we generated a new record using carbonate clumped isotopes (Δ47) and compared our results with Mg/Ca-based estimates for the Indian Ocean at ODP Site 761. Our results indicate temperatures of 11.0 $\pm$ 1.7$\,^{\circ}$C during the middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO, 14.7--17 Ma) and 8.1 $\pm$ 1.9$\,^{\circ}$C after the middle Miocene Climate Transition (MCT, 13.0--14.7 Ma), values 6 to 9$\,^{\circ}$C warmer than present. Our record also indicates cooling across the MCT of 2.9 $\pm$ 2.5$\,^{\circ}$C (uncertainties 95\% confidence level). The Mg/Ca record derived from the same samples indicates temperatures well within uncertainty of Δ47. As the two proxies are affected by different non-thermal biases, the good agreement provides confidence in these reconstructed temperatures. Our Δ47 temperature record implies a 0.6‰ seawater δ18O change over the MCT, in good agreement with previously published values from other sites. Our data furthermore confirm overall high seawater δ18O values across the middle Miocene, at face value suggesting ice volumes exceeding present-day despite the warm bottom water temperatures. This finding suggests previously underappreciated additional influences on seawater δ18O and/or a decoupling of ice volume and ocean temperature.},

@article{lebratoGlobalVariabilitySeawater2020,
	abstract = {Seawater Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios are biogeochemical parameters reflecting the Earth--ocean--atmosphere dynamic exchange of elements. The ratios' dependence on the environment and organisms' biology facilitates their application in marine sciences. Here, we present a measured single-laboratory dataset, combined with previous data, to test the assumption of limited seawater Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca variability across marine environments globally. High variability was found in open-ocean upwelling and polar regions, shelves/neritic and river-influenced areas, where seawater Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios range from ∼4.40 to 6.40 mmol:mol and ∼6.95 to 9.80 mmol:mol, respectively. Open-ocean seawater Mg:Ca is semiconservative (∼4.90 to 5.30 mol:mol), while Sr:Ca is more variable and nonconservative (∼7.70 to 9.10 mmol:mol); both ratios are nonconservative in coastal seas. Further, the Ca, Mg, and Sr elemental fluxes are connected to large total alkalinity deviations from International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard values. Because there is significant modern seawater Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios variability across marine environments we cannot absolutely assume that fossil archives using taxa-specific proxies reflect true global seawater chemistry but rather taxa- and process-specific ecosystem variations, reflecting regional conditions. This variability could reconcile secular seawater Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratio reconstructions using different taxa and techniques by assuming an error of 1 to 1.50 mol:mol, and 1 to 1.90 mmol:mol, respectively. The modern ratios' variability is similar to the reconstructed rise over 20 Ma (Neogene Period), nurturing the question of seminonconservative behavior of Ca, Mg, and Sr over modern Earth geological history with an overlooked environmental effect.},

Mg/Ca data follow a general climatic trend, with lower values during cold intervals (i.e., marine isotope stages (MIS) 2--4) and higher values during warm intervals (i.e., MIS 1 and 5). Fe/Ca and Al/Ca data reveal distinct intervals in which concentrations are elevated tenfold or more over baseline values, with highly variable elemental ratios in these intervals. The Mg/Ca data are highly correlated with the Fe/Ca and Al/Ca data in these intervals, with slopes of 1.13 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.66 $\pm$ 0.07 mole/mole, respectively. Examination of the sediments from these intervals reveals that they are rich in volcanic debris that is likely derived from Gal{\'a}pagos volcanic rocks. The presence of small amounts of this volcanic debris can bias shell Mg/Ca to elevated values. Attempts to use enhanced cleaning to remove the volcanic particles were largely unsuccessful. The most successful strategy is to use the Fe/Ca and Al/Ca from the shell digests along with the Fe to Mg ratio of the volcanic debris to correct the Mg/Ca data for Al-silicate contamination, in which case the corrected data more clearly reveal the primary climatological patterns. Mn/Ca and U/Ca data are characterized by cycles of 20--200 cm length, with Mn/Ca having a distinct trend toward higher values between the core top and 200 cm. These trends appear to be related to diagenetic coatings on the foraminifera shells, most likely in the form of Mn-carbonates.},

	abstract = {Evidence is emerging that the tropical climate system played a major role in global climate change during the last deglaciation. However, existing studies show that deglacial warming was asynchronous across the tropical band, complicating the identification of causal mechanisms. The Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico is ideally located to record subtropical Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) warming in relation to meltwater input from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Paired δ18O and Mg/Ca data on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from core EN32-PC6 are used to separate deglacial changes in SST and δ18O of seawater. SST as calculated from Mg/Ca data increased by \&gt;3 $\,^{\circ}$C from ca. 17.2 to 15.5 ka in association with Heinrich event 1 and was not in phase with Greenland air temperature. Subtracting temperature effects from δ18O values in G. ruber reveals two excursions representing Laurentide meltwater input to the Gulf of Mexico, one of \&gt;1.5‰ from ca. 16.1 to 15.6 ka and a second major spike of \&gt;2.5‰ from ca. 15.2 to 13.0 ka that encompassed meltwater pulse 1A and peaked ca. 13.8 ka during the B{\o}lling-{\AA}ller{\o}d. Conversion to salinity through the use of a Laurentide meltwater end member of −25‰ indicates that near-surface salinity decreased by 2‰--4‰ during these spikes. These results suggest that Gulf of Mexico SST warming preceded peak Laurentide Ice Sheet decay and the B{\o}lling-{\AA}ller{\o}d interval by \&gt;2 k.y. and that heat was retained in the subtropical Atlantic during Heinrich event 1, consistent with modulation of deglacial climate by thermohaline circulation.},

	abstract = {Arthropoda, which represent nearly 80\% of all known animal species, are protected by an exoskeleton formed by their cuticle. The cuticle represents a hierarchically structured multifunctional biocomposite based on chitin and proteins. Some groups, such as Crustacea, reinforce the load-bearing parts of their cuticle with calcite. As the calcite sometimes contains Mg it was speculated that Mg may have a stiffening impact on the mechanical properties of the cuticle (Becker et al., Dalton Trans. (2005) 1814). Motivated by these facts, we present a theoretical parameter-free quantum-mechanical study of the phase stability and structural and elastic properties of Mg-substituted calcite crystals. The Mg-substitutions were chosen as examples of states that occur in complex chemical environments typical for biological systems in which calcite crystals contain impurities, the role of which is still the topic of debate. Density functional theory calculations of bulk (Ca,Mg)CO3 were performed employing 30-atom supercells within the generalized gradient approximation as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package. Based on the calculated thermodynamic results, low concentrations of Mg atoms are predicted to be stable in calcite crystals in agreement with experimental findings. Examining the structural characteristics, Mg additions nearly linearly reduce the volume of substituted crystals. The predicted elastic bulk modulus results reveal that the Mg substitution nearly linearly stiffens the calcite crystals. Due to the quite large size-mismatch of Mg and Ca atoms, Mg substitution results in local distortions such as off-planar tilting of the CO32- group.},

	abstract = {Measurements of SrCa of benthic foraminifera show a linear decrease with water depth which is superimposed upon significant variability identified by analyses of individual foraminifera. New data for CdCa support previous work in defining a contrast between waters shallower and deeper than ∼ 2500 m. Measured element partition coefficients in foraminiferal calcium carbonate relative to sea water (D) have been described by means of a one-box model in which elements are extracted by Rayleigh distillation from a biomineralization reservoir that serves for calcification with a constant fractionation factor (α), such that D = (1 − fα)(1 − f), where f is the proportion of Ca remaining after precipitation. A modification to the model recognises differences in element speciation. The model is consistent with differences between DSr, DBa and DCd in benthic but not planktonic foraminifera. Depth variations in D for Sr and Ba are consistent with the model, as are differences in depth variation of DCd in calcitic and aragonitic benthic foraminifera. The shallower depth variations may reflect increasing calcification rates with increasing water depth to an optimum of about 2500 m. Observations of unusually lower DCd for some deep waters, not accompanied by similar DSr or DBa, may be because of dissolution or a calcification response to a lower carbonate saturation state.},

@article{yuSeawaterCarbonateIond13C2008,
	abstract = {Seawater carbonate ion and δ13C are affected by many processes including biology, air--sea exchange, alkalinity change, and mixing between different water masses. Study of modern ocean data shows that deep ocean carbonate ion and δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon can be used together as useful tracers for deep water mass reconstructions in the past. We present records of deep water carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]) changes of the North Atlantic Ocean water column since the last glacial, quantitatively reconstructed using benthic foraminiferal boron/calcium (B/Ca) ratios. Records from six cores over 1 to 4 km reveal that the carbonate chemistry of the glacial North Atlantic was more stratified than the modern ocean, with higher [CO32−] by {\textasciitilde}20--30 μmol kg−1 at 1--2 km and lower [CO32−] by {\textasciitilde}20 μmol kg−1 at sites deeper than 3.5 km, producing an 800 m glacial shoaling of calcite saturation horizon. Comparison with benthic foraminiferal δ13C and ɛNd of Fe--Mn oxide leachates shows that the deep glacial waters with low-[CO32−] are consistent with a Southern Ocean source, while those with high-[CO32−] but distinct δ13C chemistry were supplied by two endemic sources, one being the Norwegian--Greenland Sea (NGS). Our carbonate ion results suggest that the glacial boundary between north and south sourced deep waters is at {\textasciitilde}2.8 km, significantly deeper than {\textasciitilde}2.3 km estimated from benthic foraminiferal δ13C. Weakened surface compensation inflow to the NGS promoted cooling and continental ice growth at north high-latitude, and a deeper boundary may reduce atmospheric CO2 sequestration in the deep Atlantic, implying a greater role of other parts of the ocean.},

For earlier periods in Earth's history, the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is much less certain, and the relation between pCO2 and climate remains poorly constrained. We use boron/calcium ratios in foraminifera to estimate pCO2 during major climate transitions of the past 20 million years. During the Middle Miocene, when temperatures were ∼3$\,^{\circ}$ to 6$\,^{\circ}$C warmer and sea level was 25 to 40 meters higher than at present, pCO2 appears to have been similar to modern levels. Decreases in pCO2 were apparently synchronous with major episodes of glacial expansion during the Middle Miocene (∼14 to 10 million years ago) and Late Pliocene (∼3.3 to 2.4 million years ago).},

@article{hemmingBoronIsotopicComposition1992,
	abstract = {The boron isotopic compositions and boron concentrations of selected modern marine carbonates were analysed by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry with a 2σ reproducibility of standards and samples better than 0.7\%. It was found that the boron isotopic compositions of modern marine carbonates fall within a relatively narrow range (
+22.1 $\pm$ 3\%. relative to NBS SRM951 boric acid standard) for all samples (biogenic, nonbiogenic, warm water, cold water, aragonitic, or calcitic). This is about 17\%. lighter than seawater. This indicates that mineralogy, temperature, and vital effects are not primary controls on the observed isotopic composition. The narrow range in isotopic composition is in contrast to the wide range in boron concentrations of these samples (10.9--71.4 ppm). The boron isotopic compositions and boron concentrations in modern marine carbonates are consistent with preferential adsorption of the isotopically lighter B(OH)
4
1− aqueous species over the B(OH)
3 species before incorporation into the carbonate site. Because there is a pH control on the availability of B(OH)

All detected tephras were deposited during the late Holocene, with no horizons present in the peat between ca. 3000--5000 years ago. The prevalence of the Alaskan White River Ash eastern lobe (AD 847 $\pm$ 1) is confirmed across the eastern seaboard from Newfoundland to Maine and a regional depositional pattern from Mount St Helens Set W (AD 1479--1482) is presented. The first occurrences of four additional cryptotephras in eastern North America are described, three of which may originate from source regions in Mexico, Kamchatka (Russia) and Hokkaido (Japan). The possibility of such tephras reaching eastern North America presents the opportunity to link palaeo-archives from the tropics and eastern Asia with those from the western Atlantic seaboard, aiding inter-regional comparisons of proxy-climatic records.},

@article{marshallDevitrificationNaturalGlass1961,
	abstract = {Many aspects of the history of natural glasses are related to the physicochemical properties of silicate melts. Glasses are thermodynamically unstable; with time and under a variety of conditions, they become crystalline. When little water is present, devitrification may be described in much the same terms as those which apply to the crystallization of silicate melts. The writer uses simple rate theory and the available experimental data to set an approximate lower limit to the time required for thermal reconstruction of natural glasses as a function of temperature. The time required for a glass at 300$\,^{\circ}$ C to become a felsite is estimated to be at least a million years, at 400$\,^{\circ}$ C, at least a few thousand years. The secular disappearance of strain birefringence in volcanic glasses at low temperatures indicates an intermediate stage in the process of devitrification.Devitrification along fractures in most volcanic glasses, however, is dependent upon water. In a number of samples, the width of the layer hydrothermally reconstructed is moderate to vanishingly small. The geologic ages of these glasses indicate that the rate of devitrification at low temperature (around 20$\,^{\circ}$ C) is no more than about 4--5 μ in 100 million years. Hydrothermal reconstruction is very sensitive to temperature; the depth of devitrification generally varies substantially among macroscopically unaltered samples from a single flow. In the least devitrified specimens, the depth of devitrification seems to be related to the age of the flow.Presumably, the diffusion of water controls the rate of hydrothermal reconstruction. The diffusion constant at 20$\,^{\circ}$ C is estimated to be 10−23 cm2/sec, and pressure-bomb experiments indicate an activation energy of 30 kcal/mole. Time-temperature relationships are estimated for hydrothermal reconstruction. In contrast to thermal reconstruction, devitrification in the presence of water requires only a short time (within experimental range) at temperatures no more than about 300$\,^{\circ}$ C.},

@article{capraClimaticFluctuationsSignificant2013,
	abstract = {Climate oscillations have significantly contributed to the planet's evolution, including volcanic activity. Major glaciations have been considered not only as a triggering mechanism for large magmatic eruptions but also inducing volcano instability. Generally, volcano instability can be inferred from detailed volcanological and structural studies of a volcano and its associated depositional sequence, but the triggering mechanism has been always difficult to infer. In this paper, we present evidence of how climatic variations during the Late Pleistocene could have forced sector collapses of the main Mexican stratovolcanoes and enhanced the mobility of associated massive flows inducing the transformation of debris avalanche into debris flows. In particular, the climatic record based on atmospheric moisture content from robustly dated lake record from Guatemala and a U/Th dated speleothem from New Mexico are used here as indicators of summer and winter precipitation. Depositional sequences associated with Late Pleistocene sector collapses of Volc{\'a}n de Colima, Nevado de Toluca, Citlalt{\'e}petl (Pico de Orizaba) and Cofre de Perote volcanoes are here analyzed. Comparing the timing of the event with the climatic record, a combination of summer and/or winter pluvial conditions could have forced and triggered the failure of already unstable volcanoes, even during glacier advances (as for the Citlalt{\'e}petl event). Independent of the main cause of the volcano instability (magmatic or tectonic) it is important to highlight that the climatic factor played an important role in enhancing the volcano instability and promoted the lateral transformation of debris avalanches, which under dry conditions would have affected more limited areas.},

	abstract = {A general feedback between volcanism and climate at times of transition in the Quaternary climate record is suggested, exemplified by events accompanying the Toba eruption (∼74,000 yr ago), the largest known late Quaternary explosive volcanic eruption. The Toba paroxysm occurred during the δ18O stage 5a-4 transition, a period of rapid ice growth and falling global sea level, which may have been a factor in creating stresses that triggered the volcanic event. Toba is estimated to have produced between 1015 and 1016 g of fine ash and sulfur gases lofted in co-ignimbrite ash clouds to heights of at least 32 $\pm$ 5 km, which may have led to dense stratospheric dust and sulfuric acid aerosol clouds. These conditions could have created a brief, dramatic cooling or "volcanic winter," followed by estimated annual Northern Hemisphere surface-temperature decreases of ∼3$\,^{\circ}$ to 5$\,^{\circ}$C caused by the longer-lived aerosols. Summer temperature decreases of ⩾10$\,^{\circ}$C at high northern latitudes, adjacent to regions already covered by snow and ice, might have increased snow cover and sea-ice extent, accelerating the global cooling already in progress. Evidence for such climate-volcanic feedback, following Milankovitch periodicities, is found at several climatic transitions.},

Site 882 provides the first high-resolution GRAPE density, magnetic susceptibility, carbonate, opal, total organic carbon, and foraminifers (planktonic and benthic) stable isotope records between 3.2 and 2.4 Ma in the North Pacific Ocean. We observe a dramatic increase in ice-rafting debris at Site 882 at 2.75 Ma, which is coeval with that found in the Norwegian Sea, suggesting that the Arctic and northeast Asia were significantly glaciated from 2.75 Ma onward. At Site 882 this major change was accompanied by a dramatic drop in sea-surface temperatures ({\textgreater}7.5$\,^{\circ}$C) and opal mass accumulation rates (fivefold decrease), and is overlain by a more gradual long-term decrease in both total organic carbon and CaCO3 MARs. We suggest that the onset of Eurasian Arctic and northeast Asia glaciation is about 100 k.y. before the glaciation of Alaska and 200 k.y. before the glaciation of Greenland and the northeast American continent. We suggest that the initiation and intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation was forced by changes in the orbital parameters: in particular, the gradual increase in the amplitude of obliquity from 3.5 to 2.5 Ma and a sharp rise in the amplitude of precession and thus insolation between 2.8 and 2.55 Ma.},

@article{maslinContributionOrbitalForcing1998,
	abstract = {In this study, we reconstruct the timing of the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. This began in the late Miocene with a significant build-up of ice on Southern Greenland. However, progressive intensification of glaciation did not begin until 3.5--3Ma, when the Greenland ice sheet expanded to include Northern Greenland. Following this stage we suggest that the Eurasian Arctic and Northeast Asia were glaciated at approximately 2.74Ma, 40ka before the glaciation of Alaska (2.70Ma) and about 200ka before significant glaciation of the North East American continent (2.54Ma). We also review the suggested causes of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Tectonic changes, such as the uplift of the Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau, the deepening of the Bering Strait and the emergence of the Panama Isthmus, are too gradual to account entirely for the speed of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. We, therefore, postulate that tectonic changes may have brought global climate to a critical threshold, but the relatively rapid variations in the Earth's orbital parameters and thus insolation, triggered the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. This theory is supported by computer simulations, which despite the relative simplicity of the model and the approximation of some factors (e.g. using a linear carbon dioxide scenario, neglecting the geographical difference between the Pliocene and the present) suggest that it is possible to build-up Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, between 2.75 and 2.55Ma, by varying only the insolation controlled by the orbital parameters.},

	abstract = {Ongoing deglaciation in Iceland not only causes uplift at the surface but also increases magma production at depth due to decompression of the mantle. Here we study glacially induced decompression melting using 3-D models of glacial isostatic adjustment in Iceland since 1890. We find that the mean glacially induced pressure rate of change in the mantle increases melt production rates by 100--135\%, or an additional 0.21--0.23 km3 of magma per year beneath Iceland. Approximately 50\% of this melt is produced underneath central Iceland. The greatest volumetric increase is found directly beneath Iceland's largest ice cap, Vatnaj{\"o}kull, colocated with the most productive volcanoes. Our models of the effect of deglaciation on mantle melting predict a significantly larger volumetric response than previous models which only considered the effect of deglaciation of Vatnaj{\"o}kull, and only mantle melting directly below Vatnaj{\"o}kull. Although the ongoing deglaciation significantly increases the melt production rate, the increase in melt supply rate at the base of the lithosphere is delayed and depends on the melt ascent velocity through the mantle. Assuming that 25\% of the melt reaches the surface, the upper limit on our deglaciation-induced melt estimates for central Iceland would be equivalent to an eruption the size of the 2010 Eyjafjallaj{\"o}kull summit eruption every seventh year.},

@article{jullEffectDeglaciationMantle1996,
	abstract = {The spreading ridge on Iceland shows large variations in eruption rate over the last 10,000 years. An increase of about 30 times the steady state value, between 10,000 and 8000 years ago, coincides with the disappearance of ice at the end of the last ice age. We examine the possibility that deglaciation caused this increase by modeling the effect on melt generation of the removal of an axisymmetric ice sheet from a spreading ridge. Our calculations take into account the influence of both a nonhydrostatic stress field and viscous flow. The results show that the average melting rate is increased by about 30 times its steady state value when a 2-km-thick ice sheet melts in 1000 years. The effect of the glacial cycle of loading and unloading is to cause a nonlinear modulation in the melt production. The factor of 30 increase in melt generation during the 1-kyr unloading can occur only because melt generation is reduced for about 60 kyr after the ice load is applied. The total volume of magma that can be produced from the deglaciation of Iceland is about 3100 km3. The concentrations of the light rare earth elements in the melt produced by deglaciation near the center of the ice sheet are about 15\% less than those in melts produced by steady state melting. Transport time for the melt to reach the surface is not yet well constrained but is likely to be less than ∼1 kyr.},

@article{gudmundssonMechanicalAspectsPostglacial1986,
	abstract = {Four major NE trending postglacial volcanic and tectonic fissure swarms (volcanic systems) occur on the Reykjanes Peninsula, and the westernmost three are the main subject of this paper. Two main types of basaltic volcanoes are associated with these systems: shields of picrite and olivine tholeiite and tholeiite fissures. The average volume of 26 shields is 1.11 km3, and the total production is 29 km3, whereas the corresponding figures for lavas from 101 volcanic fissures are 0.11 km3 and 11 km3. The tectonic fractures are either tension fractures or normal faults of widths up to 20 m, throws up to 10 m, and lengths up to several kilometers. The volcanism and tectonics can be explained by magmatic pressure changes in ellipsoidal magma reservoirs located beneath the fissure swarms. A magmatic pressure increase of the order of 10 MPa is found to be sufficient for an excess uplift of the order of several meters, which is all that is needed to account for the fractures and measured dilation in the fissure swarms. It is concluded that most shield volcanoes, in particular the picrite shields and the large olivine tholeiite shields, formed during the early postglacial period and that their formation was facilitated by the stress field generated as a result of rapid uplift and bending of the crust above the reservoirs. Since that time the reservoirs have become independent systems, the volcanism has been confined to fissures, and the production rate has decreased significantly. During typical fissure eruptions (0.015 km3), only the uppermost several hundred meters of the source reservoir, depending on its magma content, supply magma to the eruption.},

@article{maclennanLinkVolcanismDeglaciation2002,
	abstract = {Temporal variation in the eruption rate and lava composition in the rift zones of Iceland is associated with deglaciation. Average eruption rates after the end of the last glacial period, ∼12 kyr BP, were up to 100 times higher than those from both the glacial period and recent times ({\textless}5 kyr BP). This peak in volcanic activity finished less than 2 kyr after the end of deglaciation. New geochemical data from ∼80 basalt and picrite samples from the Theistareykir and Krafla volcanic systems show that there is a temporal variation in both the major and trace element composition of the eruptions. Early postglacial eruptions show a greater range in MgO contents than eruptions from other times, and at a fixed MgO content, the concentration of incompatible elements in subglacial eruptions is higher than that in early postglacial eruptions. Recent eruptions from the Krafla system have similar compositions to subglacial eruptions. The high eruption rates and low rare earth element (REE) concentrations in the lava from early postglacial times can be accounted for by increased melt generation rates in the shallow mantle caused by unloading of an ice sheet. Magma chamber processes such as crystallization and assimilation can produce the temporal variation in REE contents if garnet is present. However, garnet is not observed as a phenocryst or xenocryst phase and is not required to match the variation in major element contents observed at Krafla and Theistareykir. If the increase in eruption rates reflects increased melt production rates in the mantle, then the relative timing of deglaciation and the burst in eruption rates can be used to estimate the rate of melt transport in the mantle. The observed duration of enhanced eruption rates after deglaciation can be reproduced if the vertical melt extraction velocity is {\textgreater}50 m yr−1.},

	abstract = {Human-induced climate change is causing rapid melting of ice in many volcanically active regions. Over glacial-interglacial time scales changes in surface loading exerted by large variations in glacier size affect the rates of volcanic activity. Numerical models suggest that smaller changes in ice volume over shorter time scales may also influence rates of mantle melt generation. However, this effect has not been verified in the geological record. Furthermore, the time lag between climatic forcing and a resultant change in the frequency of volcanic eruptions is unknown. We present empirical evidence that the frequency of volcanic eruptions in Iceland was affected by glacial extent, modulated by climate, on multicentennial time scales during the Holocene. We examine the frequency of volcanic ash deposition over northern Europe and compare this with Icelandic eruptions. We identify a period of markedly reduced volcanic activity centered on 5.5--4.5 ka that was preceded by a major change in atmospheric circulation patterns, expressed in the North Atlantic as a deepening of the Icelandic Low, favoring glacial advance on Iceland. We calculate an apparent time lag of ∼600 yr between the climate event and change in eruption frequency. Given the time lag identified here, increase in volcanic eruptions due to ongoing deglaciation since the end of the Little Ice Age may not become apparent for hundreds of years.},

The large pulse in volcanic production at the end of the last glaciation in Iceland suggests a link between unloading and volcanism, and models of that process can help to evaluate future scenarios.

An annual cycle of land elevation in Iceland, due to seasonal variation of ice mass, indicates an annual modulation of failure conditions in subglacial magma chambers.},

This change occurred very rapidly, perhaps within 2000 yr, too quickly to be a direct response to either tectonic or orbital forcing.

@article{blockleyNewLessDestructive2005,
	abstract = {Tephrochronology, a key tool in the correlation of Quaternary sequences, relies on the extraction of tephra shards from sediments for visual identification and high-precision geochemical comparison. A prerequisite for the reliable correlation of tephra layers is that the geochemical composition of glass shards remains unaltered by natural processes (e.g. chemical exchange in the sedimentary environment) and/or by laboratory analytical procedures. However, natural glasses, particularly when in the form of small shards with a high surface to volume ratio, are prone to chemical alteration in both acidic and basic environments. Current techniques for the extraction of distal tephra from sediments involve the `cleaning' of samples in precisely such environments and at elevated temperatures. The acid phase of the `cleaning' process risks alteration of the geochemical signature of the shards, while the basic phase leads to considerable sample loss through dissolution of the silica network. Here, we illustrate the degree of alteration and loss to which distal tephras may be prone, and introduce a less destructive procedure for their extraction. This method is based on stepped heavy liquid flotation and which results in samples of sufficient quality for analysis while preserving their geochemical integrity. In trials, this method out-performed chemical extraction procedures in terms of the number of shards recovered and has resulted in the detection of new tephra layers with low shard concentrations. The implications of this study are highly significant because (i) the current database of distal tephra records and their corresponding geochemical signatures may require refinement and (ii) the record of distal tephras may be incomplete due to sample loss induced by corrosive laboratory procedures. It is therefore vital that less corrosive laboratory procedures are developed to make the detection and classification of distal glass tephra more secure. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The upper part of the record which spans the mid Holocene to MIS 5e4 (the last ca 105,000 years) has been investigated for tephra content. A total of 25 discrete tephra layers were discovered, only one of which was visible in the core sequence. The other 24 are not visible to the naked eye, nor were the majority detected by routine down-core scanning methods. A total of 625 geochemical measurements obtained from individual glass shards using WDS-EPMA enabled 21 of the 25 tephras to be assigned to known volcanic events emanating from the Campanian Province (Campi Flegrei, Somma-Vesuvius and Ischia Island). The results provide an independent basis for establishing an ageedepth profile for the upper part of the PRAD 1-2 record. This study demonstrates that the number of non-visible tephra layers can significantly exceed the number of visible layers in some deep marine sequences. Routine testing for the presence of non-visible tephra layers can therefore prove rewarding, leading to the detection of additional isochrons for dating and correlating marine sequences, and for their synchronisation with terrestrial records.},

Here we present a new and detailed tephrochronological framework for the time period 25,000e45,000 a b2k that brings together results from 4 deep Greenland ice-cores. In total, 99 tephra deposits, the majority of which are preserved as cryptotephra, are described from the NGRIP, NEEM, GRIP and DYE-3 records. The major element signatures of single glass shards within these deposits indicate that 93 are basaltic in composition all originating from Iceland. Specifically, 43 originate from Grimsvo€tn, 20 are thought to be sourced from the Katla volcanic system and 17 show affinity to the Kverkfjo€ll system. Robust geochemical characterisations, independent ages derived from the GICC05 ice-core chronology, and the stratigraphic positions of these deposits relative to the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate events represent a key framework that provides new information on the frequency and nature of volcanic events in the North Atlantic region between GS-3 and GI-12. Of particular importance are 19 tephra deposits that lie on the rapid climatic transitions that punctuate the last glacial period. This framework of well-constrained, time-synchronous tie-lines represents an important step towards the independent synchronisation of marine, terrestrial and ice-core records from the North Atlantic region, in order to assess the phasing of rapid climatic changes during the last glacial period.},

	abstract = {From its Icelandic origins in the study of visible tephra horizons, tephrochronology took a remarkable step in the late 1980 s with the discovery of a ca. 4300-year-old microscopic ash layer in a Scottish peat bog. Since then, the search for these cryptotephra deposits in distal areas has gone from strength to strength. Indeed, a recent discovery demonstrates how a few fine-grained glass shards from an Alaskan eruption have been dispersed more than 7000 km to northern Europe. Instantaneous deposition of geochemically distinct volcanic ash over such large geographical areas gives rise to a powerful correlation tool with considerable potential for addressing a range of scientific questions. A prerequisite of this work is the establishment of regional tephrochronological frameworks that include well-constrained age estimates and robust geochemical signatures for each deposit. With distal sites revealing a complex record of previously unknown volcanic events, frameworks are regularly revised, and it has become apparent that some closely timed eruptions have similar geochemical signatures. The search for unique and robust geochemical fingerprints thus hinges on rigorous analysis by electron microprobe and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Historical developments and significant breakthroughs are presented to chart the revolution in correlation and precision dating over the last 50 years using tephrochronology and cryptotephrochronology.},

@techreport{lohmannIceCoreEvidence2022,
	abstract = {A significant influence of major volcanic eruptions on regime shifts and long-term climate variability has been suggested previously. But a statistical assessment of this has been hampered by inaccurate synchronization of large volcanic eruptions to changes in past climate. Here, this is achieved by combining a new record of bipolar volcanism from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores with records of abrupt climate change derived from the same ice cores. We show that bipolar volcanic 5 eruptions occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance just before the onset of Dansgaard-Oeschger events, the most prominent large-scale abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period. Out of 20 abrupt warming events in the 12-60 ka period, 5 (7) occur within 20 (50) years after a bipolar eruption. A similar statistical relationship is not found for eruptions before the abrupt cooling phases of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. We hypothesize that this asymmetric response to volcanic eruptions may be a result of the direct influence of volcanic cooling on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which 10 is widely regarded as the main climate subsystem involved in Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. Transitions from a weak to a strong circulation mode, but not vice versa, may be triggered by cooling in the North Atlantic, given the circulation is close to a stability threshold. We illustrate this suggestion by simulations with a global ocean model forced by short-term volcanic cooling. The analysis presented suggests that large eruptions may act as short-term triggers for large-scale abrupt climate change, and may explain part of the variability of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles.},

@article{poppelmeierNeodymiumIsotopesPaleowater2022,
	abstract = {Proxy reconstructions from deep ocean sediments have helped to shape our understanding of the role of the global overturning circulation in past climate change. Neodymium (Nd) isotopes have contributed to this knowledge, as a tracer of past bottom water provenance and mixing. Here, we extend the implementation of Nd isotopes in the physical-biogeochemical Bern3D model by revising a number of critical parameterizations, which result in an improved description of the marine Nd cycle. We exploit the dynamically consistent framework of the model, which allows us to assess the processes driving nonconservative Nd isotope behavior with a particular focus on the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its substantially different climatic, oceanic, and biogeochemical boundary conditions. We show that the more radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions found throughout the glacial ocean can be explained by changes in the weathering input fluxes and do not require large reorganizations of the deep circulation. Our findings further highlight that the Nd isotopic composition of a water mass can not only be significantly affected by a benthic Nd flux, but also be modified by the vertical downward transport of Nd via reversible scavenging. While these non-conservative processes only have a limited impact in the modern ocean, they were substantially more pronounced during the LGM and mostly independent of the circulation state, with their contributions being non-linear, partially opposing, and spatially variable. During the transiently simulated deglaciation Nd isotope variations induced by major circulation weakenings and resumptions are found to be most pronounced in the South Atlantic, while they are increasingly muted towards the north. Hence, it emerges that the interpretation of authigenic Nd isotope records requires more spatially specific considerations of non-conservative processes in order to more reliably infer basin-scale ocean circulation and water mass mixing of the past.},

@article{yuPreferentialDissolutionBenthic2007,
	abstract = {We have investigated the effect of cleaning procedures on eight element/Ca ratios in three widely used benthic foraminifera species from core top and down core sediments. Two cleaning techniques were employed: (1) comparison between ``Mg-cleaning'' and ``Cd-cleaning'' methods and (2) comparison between the various constituent reagents. Li/Ca, B/Ca, and Sr/Ca ratios remained unchanged for samples subjected to different treatments, but Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Cd/Ca, and U/Ca were substantially decreased when foraminifera shells were cleaned with reagents containing citrate. In contrast, no significant decreases in element/Ca ratios were observed for samples cleaned in N2H4 without citrate, indicating that the role of N2H4 was insignificant during reductive cleaning and that citrate is responsible for decreases of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Cd/Ca, and U/Ca. Decreases in these ratios are most likely due to (1) removal of contaminant particles enriched in Mg, Mn, Zn, Cd and U and/or (2) preferential leaching of CaCO3 by the formation of stable metal complexes through chelation between citrate and metals heterogeneously distributed in foraminiferal shells. Due to the negligible effect of N2H4 and preferential dissolution of CaCO3 during reductive cleaning, it is suggested that the reductive cleaning step should be omitted and the ``Mg-cleaning'' method [Barker et al., 2003] could be employed to clean foraminiferal shells for trace element measurements.},

@article{farmerBoricAcidBorate2019,
	abstract = {The boron concentration (B/Ca ratio) and isotopic composition (d11B) of biogenic calcite are widely applied to reconstruct past changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. Knowledge of B incorporation pathways into calcite is critical for these applications and for improving the theoretical basis of B proxies. While the canonical interpretation of d11B holds that B in calcite predominantly derives from dissolved borate anion in seawater, recent studies of the B content, coordination, and isotopic composition in calcite suggest more complex B incorporation pathways. To provide new insights into these pathways, here we present d11B of inorganic calcite precipitated from saline solutions of varying pH, calcium and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration for which B/Ca data were previously reported by Uchikawa et al. (2015). Results show that calcite d11B significantly increases with increasing pH and decreases with increasing [Ca2+] and [DIC]. In combination, these experiments show that the difference in d11B between solid calcite and aqueous borate linearly decreases with increasing calcite precipitation rate. To interpret these data, we present the first application of surface kinetic modeling (SKM) to boron incorporation. The SKM can simultaneously explain ratedependent B/Ca and d11B patterns observed in our and previously published inorganic calcite precipitation experiments when both aqueous borate and boric acid contribute to boron in inorganic calcite. If the B incorporation mechanism shown here for inorganic calcite is applicable to biogenic calcite, precipitation rate variations could modify d11B patterns by changing the contributions of aqueous boric acid and borate to boron in calcite. However, better knowledge of biogenic calcite precipitation mechanisms and rates is needed to assess the importance of this effect for applications of B proxies in biogenic carbonates.},

This is the first REE/Nd dataset on solution and different-sized particles collected at the same site. We present direct evidence of the Nd isotopic exchange between particulate lithogenic fraction and seawater without significant mass transfer.

We propose a new approach to estimate the residence time of Nd in the ocean (τNd) based on isotopic exchange: 200 yr {\textless} τNd{\textless} 1000 yr. The exchange requires a partial dissolution of lithogenic Nd. We estimate that the fraction of soluble Nd proportion in atmospheric dust is of the order of 20\% based on the isotopic ratios.

@article{tachikawaNeodymiumAssociatedForaminiferal2014,
	abstract = {Neodymium isotopic ratios in marine environments have been used as a tracer of water masses and exchange processes between dissolved and particulate phases. The interest in this tracer has been growing with improvement of our knowledge on its chemical behaviour in the modern ocean and the identification of sedimentary phases that preserve past seawater Nd values. In the last few decades the Nd isotopic composition measured on FeeMn crusts, sediment leachates, bulk carbonate fraction, corals and fish teeth have been increasingly interpreted in the context of understanding the role of the ocean in paleoclimate changes. In particular, calcareous foraminiferal tests (shells) have acquired increasing attention as an archive of seawater Nd isotopic signatures, because it allows continuous high-resolution records to be measured and directly compared to other proxies including stable isotopes and trace metals. The main challenge of interpreting the Nd isotopic composition of foraminifera is determining the origin of the Nd preserved within them. In this review, we present an overview of methodological progress including that of bulk foraminifera and microanalyses within foraminiferal tests, as well as geochemical meaning of extracted Nd concentrations and isotopic compositions. The growing body of evidence suggests that Nd isotopic signatures of sedimentary planktonic foraminifera correspond to bottom water values rather than surface water ones. The Nd-rich phases associated with sedimentary foraminifera are adhesive nano-scale particles of Mn and Fe oxides and hydroxides, and Mn-rich carbonates formed within layers of foraminiferal calcite. Mechanical cleaning to remove clay minerals is likely to be sufficient in most cases to reconstruct past bottom water circulations. Unresolved issues include the potential influence of pore water Nd on Nd values extracted from sedimentary foraminiferal tests under different sedimentalogical and oceanographic conditions.},

Correspondingly, pH was 0.15 units higher and aqueous PCO2 was 95 μatm lower at this site at the Last Glacial Maximum.

	abstract = {The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify with global warming, which likely increases the intensity of extreme precipitation events and the risk of flooding. The changes, however, often differ from the theorized expectation of increases in water‐holding capacity of the atmosphere in the warmer conditions, especially when water availability is limited. Here, the relationships of changes in extreme precipitation and flood intensities for the end of the twenty-first century with spatial and seasonal water availability are quantified. Results show an intensification of extreme precipitation and flood events over all climate regions which increases as water availability increases from dry to wet regions. Similarly, there is an increase in the intensification of extreme precipitation and flood with the seasonal cycle of water availability. The connection between extreme precipitation and flood intensity changes and spatial and seasonal water availability becomes stronger as events become less extreme.},

Here, we review deep ocean carbonate ion concentration (\${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$) changes based on the benthic foraminiferal boron-to-calcium ratio (B/Ca) and their links to global carbon reorganization since the last ice age. Existing deep ocean \${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$ reconstructions are consistent with changes in the biological pump, in ocean stratification, and in the associated oceanic alkalinity inventory as key mechanisms for modulating atmospheric CO₂ on glacial-interglacial time scales. We find that the global mean deep ocean \${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$ was roughly similar between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18,000--22,000 years ago) and the Late Holocene (0--5,000 years ago). In view of elevated glacial surface \${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$, this indicates enhanced storage of respiratory carbon in a more alkaline deep ocean during the LGM. During early deglaciation, rising \${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$ at three locations in the deep ocean suggests a release of deep-sea CO₂ to the atmosphere, probably via the Southern Ocean. Both increased late deglacial carbonate burial in deep-sea sediments due to elevated \${\textbackslash}left[\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}]{\textbackslash}right\$ and Holocene expansion of coral reefs on newly flooded continental shelves depleted global ocean alkalinity, which reduced CO₂ solubility in seawater and contributed to atmospheric CO₂ rises at these times.},

Here, we present the first down core B/Ca and δ11B records measured in an epifaunal benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi from the Caribbean Sea during the last 160 kyr. The two proxies yield quantitatively comparable deep water [CO32−] and pH results, showing high values during glacials relative to inter-glacials (differences in [CO32−] and pH are ∼ 35 μmol/kg and ∼ 0.15, respectively), consistent with past ocean circulation changes in the Caribbean Sea. Our data provide convincing evidence that both proxies serve as faithful proxies to estimate deep ocean [CO32−] and pH, despite our incomplete understanding of boron incorporation into foraminiferal carbonates.},

@article{lemarchandBoronIsotopeSystematics2002,
	abstract = {The chemical composition of the oceans and long-term climate changes are believed to be linked. Reconstruction of seawater pH evolution is desirable as pH may be related to atmospheric pCO2, and hence to climate evolution. Boron isotopes in oceanic carbonates have been suggested to be a proxy for oceanic paleo-pH reconstruction. Nevertheless, the calculation of paleo-pH values over geological periods requires a precise knowledge of the boron isotopic composition of the oceans when calcite precipitated. We present the systematics of boron isotopic composition of the world's main rivers. We deduce a continental boron flux to the oceans of 38×1010 gB/year with a mean isotopic composition of +10‰. These results lead to a balanced boron budget in the oceans and allow the development of a model for the marine boron secular evolution over the past 100 Myr. It is shown that the oceanic boron cycle is mainly controlled by the boron continental discharge and the boron uptake from the oceans during low temperature alteration of oceanic crust. However, the recent important increase of the clastic sediment supply, linked to the Himalayan erosion, impacts the oceanic boron budget by enhancing significantly the boron uptake by adsorption on sediments. We predict a boron isotopic composition in the oceans lower during the Cenozoic and slightly higher during the Cretaceous than today. The modelled values for the marine boron isotopes follow the variations of boron isotopes in carbonates over the Cenozoic era provided by previous studies, suggesting that the variations of the seawater pH may not have been important on this time scale. If this is the case, it involves that buffering mechanisms occur in the oceans to maintain seawater pH at a roughly constant value against past atmospheric pCO2 variations.},

	abstract = {Ocean pH is particularly sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide content1,2,3. Records of ocean pH can therefore be used to estimate past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The isotopic composition of boron (δ11B) contained in the carbonate shells of marine organisms varies according to pH, from which ocean pH can be reconstructed4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. This requires independent estimates of the δ11B of dissolved boron in sea water through time. The marine δ11B budget, however, is still largely unconstrained. Here we show that, by incorporating the global flux of riverine boron (as estimated from δ11B measurements in 22 of the world's main rivers), the marine boron isotope budget can be balanced. We also derive ocean δ11B budgets for the past 120 Myr. Estimated isotope compositions of boron in sea water show a remarkable consistency with records of δ11B in foraminiferal carbonates9,10,11, suggesting that foraminifera δ11B records may in part reflect changes in the marine boron isotope budget rather than changes in ocean pH over the Cenozoic era.},

	abstract = {Abstract Individual, seasonal, 300 m temperature maps were constructed over the Kuroshio Current System from 130$\,^{\circ}$E to 170$\,^{\circ}$W, for a 4-year period from summer 1976 through spring 1980, using TRANSPAC XBT data and JODC temperature/depth data. Quasi-stationary meanders in the Kuroshic Current System occurred at 137$\,^{\circ}$C (i.e., Kuroshio Meander), at 144$\,^{\circ}$E and 150$\,^{\circ}$E (i.e., lee-wave meanders), and near 160$\,^{\circ}$E (i.e., meander over the Shatsky Rise). A composite of the paths of the Kuroshio (i.e., the 12$\,^{\circ}$C isotherm) from the individual seasonal maps, and the total variance map, finds nodes (i.e., minima) and anti-nodes (i.e., maxima) of variability to have existed along the mean Kuroshio path. The anti-nodes coincided with the location of the quasi-stationary meanders, the nodes in between. Zonal propagation of temperature anomalies accounted for 20--30\% of the total interannual variance. These temperature anomalies propagated eastward at 0.5--1.5 cm s−1 in the region 140$\,^{\circ}$--155$\,^{\circ}$E, and westward at −1 to −2 cm s−1 in the region 155$\,^{\circ}$E--175$\,^{\circ}$W. In addition to this wave propagation, 31\% of the interannual variance in temperature could be explained by two empirical standing-wave modes. Within these two modes, spatial coherency in variability existed between the Kuroshio Meander, the two lee-wave meanders east of Japan and the meander over the Shatsky Rise. Both spatial patterns of variability fluctuated with a 1-year decorrelation time scale, with maximum interannual variability occurring in fall/winter and minimum interannual variability in spring/summer. In the latter part of the 4-year period (1979--80), the Kuroshio Meander became weak and the Kuroshio Extension was displaced southward, from 36--37$\,^{\circ}$N during the first 2 years to 34$\,^{\circ}$N during the latter two years. Associated with these large scale changes, the quasi-stationary meander pattern in the Kuroshio Extension became unstable, associated with increased eddy activity and ring production. In fact, ring production doubled, i.e., from 5 per year to 10 rings per year, from what it was during the previous 3 years. Prior to this regimal change, the Kuroshio Extension bifurcated near the Shatsky Rise (160$\,^{\circ}$E) with a secondary branch of the Kuroshio Extension extending northeastward along the Shatsky Rise to 40$\,^{\circ}$N, where it turned east, and with the main branch extending eastward along 36$\,^{\circ}$N. After the regional change, this bifurcation occurred much farther to the west near 150$\,^{\circ}$E.},

              et al.
              found that one result of this trend has been the strengthening of Kuroshio current transport off the coast of Japan. The Kuroshio, like its Atlantic counterpart the Gulf Stream, is a surface current that moves huge volumes of warm water from low latitudes to high ones. As strong Pacific cyclones have become stronger, they have increased the amount of energy contained in cyclonic mesoscale ocean eddies and decreased that of anticyclonic ones. This in turn has increased the transfer of energy to the Kuroshio as eddies move into the current, providing a feedback between climate warming and ocean heat transport.

          , 
            A positive feedback mechanism between tropical cyclones (TCs) and climate warming can be seen by examining TC-induced energy and potential vorticity (PV) changes of oceanic geostrophic eddies. We found that substantial dissipation of eddies, with a strong bias toward dissipation of anticyclonic eddies, is directly linked to TC activity. East of Taiwan, where TCs show a remarkable intensifying trend in recent decades, the ocean exhibits a corresponding upward trend of positive PV anomalies. Carried westward by eddies, increasing numbers of positive PV anomalies impinge on the Kuroshio current, causing the mean current to accelerate downstream. This acts in opposition to decreasing basin-scale wind stress and has a potentially important warming impact on the extratropical ocean and climate.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the factors that must be taken into account when interpreting paleoceanographic records derived from measurements of the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of foraminifera. interpreted with caution and with close consideration of a wide array of factors. The common strategies are to generate records using only one species in order to minimize the variability due to specific biological effects. Furthermore, it is common to select species that have well-known ecological preferences that are fairly predictable across regions with different oceanographic conditions in the modern ocean. Otherwise, it is difficult to interpret records accurately with respect to understanding how isotopic records might be biased by the potential effects of changes in seasonality, nutrient levels, and depth habitat, not to mention interannual variability (with exceptional blooms) and early diagenetic effects. These practices are thought to minimize variability due to biological factors, and the resulting δ18O downcore record can then be interpreted as primarily a reflection of changes in the δ18O of seawater, the temperature of calcification, and possibly ocean carbon chemistry. If the δ13O and δ13CDIC characteristics of watermasses can be reconstructed, then changes in relative flux of each water mass can be quantified using cores in the mixing zone between end-members. However, in most cases, to isolate absolute changes in local oceanographic conditions and to separate the influence of multiple effects, other paleoceanographic proxies in the same core must be analyzed, and to understand the context of a single record, comparisons with records from other regions must be made.},

@article{huEffectsBeringStrait2015,
	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that the status of the Bering Strait may have a significant influence on global climate variability on centennial, millennial, and even longer time scales. Here we use multiple versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, versions 2 and 3) to investigate the influence of the Bering Strait closure/opening on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and global mean climate under present-day, 15 thousand-year before present (kyr BP), and 112kyr BP climate boundary conditions. Our results show that regardless of the version of the model used or the widely different background climates, the Bering Strait's closure produces a robust result of a strengthening of the AMOC, and an increase in the northward meridional heat transport in the Atlantic. As a consequence, the climate becomes warmer in the North Atlantic and the surrounding regions, but cooler in the North Pacific, leading to a seesaw-like climate change between these two basins. For the first time it is noted that the absence of the Bering Strait throughflow causes a slower motion of Arctic sea ice, a reduced upper ocean water exchange between the Arctic and North Atlantic, reduced sea ice export and less fresh water in the North Atlantic. These changes contribute positively to the increased upper ocean density there, thus strengthening the AMOC. Potentially these changes in the North Atlantic could have a significant effect on the ice sheets both upstream and downstream in ice age climate, and further influence global sea level changes.},

	abstract = {Under previous reconstructions of late Pliocene boundary conditions, climate models have failed to reproduce the warm sea surface temperatures reconstructed in the North Atlantic. Using a reconstruction of mid-Piacenzian paleogeography that has the Bering Strait and Canadian Arctic Archipelago Straits closed, however, improves the simulation of the proxy-indicated warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in the Community Climate System Model. We find that the closure of these small Arctic gateways strengthens the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, by inhibiting freshwater transport from the Pacific to the Arctic Ocean and from the Arctic Ocean to the Labrador Sea, leading to warmer sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. This indicates that the state of the Arctic gateways may influence the sensitivity of the North Atlantic climate in complex ways, and better understanding of the state of these Arctic gateways for past time periods is needed.},

This study investigates the mechanisms by which a large freshwater input to the subarctic North Atlantic and an attendant rapid weakening of the AMOC influence North Pacific climate by analyzing four different ocean--atmosphere coupled general circulation models (GCMs) under present-day or preindustrial boundary conditions. When the coupled GCMs are forced with a 1-Sv (Sv [ 106 m3 s21) freshwater flux anomaly in the subarctic North Atlantic, the AMOC nearly shuts down and the North Atlantic cools significantly. The South Atlantic warms slightly, shifting the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone southward. In addition to this Atlantic ocean--atmosphere response, all of the models exhibit cooling of the North Pacific, especially along the oceanic frontal zone, consistent with paleoclimate reconstructions. The models also show deepening of the wintertime Aleutian low.},

Candidate mechanisms involve Pacific decadal variability and Atlantic multidecadal variability, elements of which involve slow fluctuations of tropical Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from positive anomalies (positive phase) to negative anomalies (negative phase). Here we use model experiments to show that there tends to be a weak opposite-sign SST response in the tropical Pacific when observed SSTs are specified in the Atlantic, while there is a weak same-sign SST response in the tropical Atlantic when observed SSTs are specified in the tropical Pacific. Net surface heat flux in the Atlantic and ocean dynamics in the Pacific play contrasting roles in the ocean response to specified SSTs in the respective basins. We propose that processes in the Pacific and Atlantic are sequentially interactive through the atmospheric Walker circulation along with contributions from midlatitude teleconnections for the Atlantic response to the Pacific.},

Results show that the THC declines similarly with an open and closed BS during hosing. However, the recovery of the THC is delayed by about a century in the closed BS simulation than in the open BS one after the hosing is off. The closed BS prevents the added freshwater being transported from the Atlantic into the Pacific via the Arctic as in the open BS case. Further, the freshwater supply is elevated significantly after the hosing by exporting the freshwater stored in the Arctic during hosing, as sea ice, back to the North Atlantic. This stabilizes the surface stratification there and suppresses the recovery of the deep convection.},

Here by using a fully coupled climate model, we show that this Pacific-Atlantic seesaw associated with changes of the AMOC can only occur when the Bering Strait is closed. As this strait is closed, the oceanic communication between the North Pacific and Atlantic is cut off. When AMOC collapses, the North Atlantic becomes cooler, but the North Pacific becomes warmer due to the buildup of the Pacific meridional overturning circulation which transports more warm and salty subtropical water into the North Pacific, leading to seesaw-like climate changes in the two ocean basins.},

	abstract = {The Bering Strait provides a shallow connection that allows freshwater to flow from the North Pacific into the North Atlantic, but this passage was closed during past glacials when sea level was at least 50 m lower than at present. Climate models investigating Bering Strait closure predict that this mechanism increases the salinity in the North Atlantic and reduces the salinity in the North Pacific, inducing a Pacific-Atlantic seesaw in meridional overturning circulation and poleward heat flux. However, the Pacific circulation response to Bering Strait closure, and thus the seesaw theory, has not been tested by long paleoceanographic records. We present long records of foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1342 in the Bering Sea, which provide the first evidence of enhanced North Pacific Intermediate Water when the Bering Strait was closed during each of the extreme glacials of the last 1.2 Myr. These results suggest that orbital-scale variations in North Pacific Intermediate Water are coherent and in phase with variations in upper North Atlantic Deep Water but are unrelated to changes in lower North Atlantic Deep Water. Together, these results provide evidence for systematic, orbital-scale variability in North Pacific Ocean circulation and may challenge the idea of an orbital-scale Pacific-Atlantic seesaw.},

	abstract = {The El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant driver of year-to-year climate variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, impacts climate pattern across the globe. However, the response of the ENSO system to past and potential future temperature increases is not fully understood. Here we investigate ENSO variability in the warmer climate of the mid-Pliocene ({\textasciitilde}3.0--3.3 Ma), when surface temperatures were {\textasciitilde}2--3 $\,^{\circ}$C above modern values, in a large ensemble of climate models---the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project. We show that the ensemble consistently suggests a weakening of ENSO variability, with a mean reduction of 25\% ($\pm$16\%). We further show that shifts in the equatorial Pacific mean state cannot fully explain these changes. Instead, ENSO was suppressed by a series of off-equatorial processes triggered by a northward displacement of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone: weakened convective feedback and intensified Southern Hemisphere circulation, which inhibit various processes that initiate ENSO. The connection between the climatological intertropical convergence zone position and ENSO we find in the past is expected to operate in our warming world with important ramifications for ENSO variability.},

@article{lohmannEffectsCO2Ocean2022,
	abstract = {Cenozoic climate changes have been linked to tectonic activity and variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Here, we present Miocene and Pliocene sensitivity experiments performed with the climate model COSMOS. The experiments contain changes with respect to paleogeography, ocean gateway configuration, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as well as a range of vertical mixing coefficients in the ocean. For the mid-Miocene, we show that the impact of ocean mixing on surface temperature is comparable to the effect of the possible range in reconstructed CO2 concentrations. In combination with stronger vertical mixing, relatively moderate CO2 concentrations of 450 ppmv enable global-mean surface, deep-water, and meridional temperature characteristics representative of mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) reconstructions. The Miocene climate shows a reduced meridional temperature gradient and reduced seasonality. In the case of enhanced mixing, surface and deep ocean temperatures show significant warming of up to 5--10$\,^{\circ}$C and an Arctic temperature anomaly of {\textgreater}12$\,^{\circ}$C. In the Pliocene simulations, the impact of vertical mixing and CO2 is less important for the deep ocean, which we interpret as a different sensitivity dependence on the background state and mixed layer dynamics. We find a significant reduction in surface albedo and effective emissivity for either a high level of atmospheric CO2 or increased vertical mixing. Our mixing sensitivity experiments provide a warm deep ocean via ocean heat uptake. We propose that the mixing hypothesis can be tested by reconstructions of the thermocline and seasonal paleoclimate data indicating a lower seasonality relative to today.},

@misc{degraafNorthPacificDeep2022,
	abstract = {Modern ocean circulation is driven by formation of deep waters in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Despite the cold temperatures at high latitudes, the North Pacific exhibits no modern deep-water formation, due to the strong halocline in the subpolar North Pacific Ocean. However, modelling results suggest the halocline was weak during the Pliocene, allowing the formation of North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW). Here we compare the oxygen isotopes from benthic foraminifera at two sites in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, ODP Sites 1208 (3346 m) and 1209 (2387 m) to understand how NPDW varied over the Plio-Pleistocene (3.3 to 2.6 Ma). While in the modern the water that occupies the deep Pacific is homogenous, during the Pliocene there was a {\textasciitilde}0.5 per mill gradient at times between sites 1208 and 1209, with, surprisingly, more positive d18O values observed at the shallower 1209. The disparity in oxygen isotopes suggests different water masses over the two sites over the Plio-Pleistocene. Oxygen isotopes of foraminifera record temperature and the d18O of seawater which loosely correlates with salinity in the modern surface oceans, with more positive d18O values generally representing more saline, colder, and therefore more dense waters. High latitude processes like sea ice formation could result in a decoupling of salinity from d18O of seawater. We suggest that the divergences in oxygen isotopes are the result of Site 1208 being bathed in southern-sourced waters, while Site 1209 is bathed in deep waters formed in the North Pacific. Modelling results suggest NPDW is a warm, saline water mass. That the divergence in d18O values between the two sites is not constant throughout this period suggests that the strength of NPDW export may have fluctuated over this interval. Future work includes Mg/Ca analyses at Site 1209 to compare with the existing record at 1208 to examine the temperature and d18O of seawater differences between these sites.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} In the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2), coupled climate models have been used to simulate an interglacial climate during the mid-Piacenzian warm period (mPWP; 3.264 to 3.025 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Ma{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Here, we compare the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), poleward ocean heat transport and sea surface warming in the Atlantic simulated with these models. In PlioMIP2, all models simulate an intensified mid-Pliocene AMOC. However, there is no consistent response in the simulated Atlantic ocean heat transport nor in the depth of the Atlantic overturning cell. The models show a large spread in the simulated AMOC maximum, the Atlantic ocean heat transport and the surface warming in the North Atlantic. Although a few models simulate a surface warming of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 8--12 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}$C{\textless}/span{\textgreater} in the North Atlantic, similar to the reconstruction from Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) version 4,{\textless}span id="page530"/{\textgreater} most models appear to underestimate this warming. The large model spread and model--data discrepancies in the PlioMIP2 ensemble do not support the hypothesis that an intensification of the AMOC, together with an increase in northward ocean heat transport, is the dominant mechanism for the mid-Pliocene warm climate over the North Atlantic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{mcclymontLessonsHighCO2World2020,
	abstract = {A range of future climate scenarios are projected for high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, given uncertainties over future human actions as well as potential environmental and climatic feedbacks. The geological record offers an opportunity to understand climate system response to a range of forcings and feedbacks which operate over multiple temporal and spatial scales. Here, we examine a single interglacial during the late Pliocene (KM5c, ca. 3.205 $\pm$ 0.01 Ma) when atmospheric CO2 exceeded pre-industrial concentrations, but were similar to today and to the lowest emission scenarios for this century. As orbital forcing and continental configurations were almost identical to today, we are able to focus on equilibrium climate system response to modern and near-future CO2. Using proxy data from 32 sites, we demonstrate that global mean sea-surface temperatures were warmer than pre-industrial values, by ∼ 2.3 ◦C for the combined proxy data (foraminifera Mg/Ca and alkenones), or by ∼ 3.2--3.4 ◦C (alkenones only). Compared to the preindustrial period, reduced meridional gradients and enhanced warming in the North Atlantic are consistently reconstructed. There is broad agreement between data and models at the global scale, with regional differences reflecting ocean circulation and/or proxy signals. An uneven distribution of proxy data in time and space does, however, add uncertainty to our anomaly calculations. The reconstructed global mean seasurface temperature anomaly for KM5c is warmer than all but three of the PlioMIP2 model outputs, and the reconstructed North Atlantic data tend to align with the warmest KM5c model values. Our results demonstrate that even under low-CO2 emission scenarios, surface ocean warming may be expected to exceed model projections and will be accentuated in the higher latitudes.},

	abstract = {Characterizing past climate states is crucial for understanding the future consequences of ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we revisit the benchmark time series for deep ocean temperature across the past 65 million years using clumped isotope thermometry. Our temperature estimates from the deep Atlantic Ocean are overall much warmer compared with oxygen isotope--based reconstructions, highlighting the likely influence of changes in deep ocean pH and/or seawater oxygen isotope composition on classical oxygen isotope records of the Cenozoic. In addition, our data reveal previously unrecognized large swings in deep ocean temperature during early Eocene acute greenhouse warmth. Our results call for a reassessment of the Cenozoic history of ocean temperatures to achieve a more accurate understanding of the nature of climatic responses to tectonic events and variable greenhouse forcing.

PlioMIP examines the consistency of model predictions in simulating Pliocene climate and their ability to reproduce climate signals preserved by geological climate archives.

However, Phase 1 demonstrated the requirement to better understand boundary condition uncertainties as well as uncertainty in the methodologies used for data--model comparison. Therefore, our strategy for Phase 2 is to utilize state-of-the-art boundary conditions that have emerged over the last 5 years. These include a new palaeogeographic reconstruction, detailing ocean bathymetry and land--ice surface topography. The ice surface topography is built upon the lessons learned from offline ice sheet modelling studies. Land surface cover has been enhanced by recent additions of Pliocene soils and lakes. Atmospheric reconstructions of palaeo-CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ are emerging on orbital timescales, and these are also incorporated into PlioMIP Phase 2. New records of surface and sea surface temperature change are being produced that will be more temporally consistent with the boundary conditions and forcings used within models. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Finally we have designed a suite of prioritized experiments that tackle issues surrounding the basic understanding of the Pliocene and its relevance in the context of future climate change in a discrete way.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{haugEffectFormationIsthmus1998,
	abstract = {The Late Cenozoic closure of the seaway between the North andSouth American continents is thought to have caused extensive changes in ocean circulation and Northern Hemisphere climate1,2. But the timing and consequences of the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama, which closed the seaway, remain controversial1,2,3,4,5. Here we present stable-isotope and carbonate sand-fraction records from Caribbean sediments which, when compared to Atlantic and Pacific palaeoceanographic records, indicate that the closure caused a marked reorganization of ocean circulation starting 4.6 million years ago. Shallowing of the seaway intensified the Gulf Stream and introduced warm and saline water masses to high northern latitudes. These changes strengthened deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea over the next million years --- as indicated by an increased deep-water ventilation and carbonate preservation in the Caribbean Sea --- and favoured early Pliocene warming of the Northern Hemisphere. The evaporative cooling of surface waters during North Atlantic Deep Water formation would have introduced moisture to the Northern Hemisphere. Although the pronounced intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation between 3.1 and 2.5 million years ago substantially lagged the full development of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, we propose that the increased atmospheric moisture content was a necessary precondition for ice-sheet growth, which was then triggered by the incremental changes in the Earth's orbital obliquity.},

The area lies in the Sudan savanna, and rain-fed agriculture is subject to periodic drought. Although river flow is also highly variable, both seasonally and between years, the floodplain represents a valuable agricultural resource. Floodplain hydrology is complicated, but surveys of flooding based on interviews with farmers, together with a study of cropping practices, reveal a complex and highly developed agriculture in the floodplain based on the cultivation of rice and sorghum varieties of known flood-tolerance. These wet-season crops are followed by vegetables grown in the dry season. Despite the sophistication and potential for development represented by the floodplain agriculture, official development has failed to capitalize upon it. Instead, attention has been focused on the development of a small area for irrigation. The Bakolori Dam, which supplies this scheme, has altered natural flooding patterns and disrupted the traditional cultivation over a wide area.]},

	abstract = {Water is considered as the most critical resource for sustainable agricultural development worldwide. Irrigated areas will increase in forthcoming years, while fresh water supplies will be diverted from agriculture to meet the increasing demand of domestic use and industry. Furthermore, the efficiency of irrigation is very low, since less than 65 \% of the applied water is actually used by the crops. The sustainable use of irrigation water is a priority for agriculture in arid areas. So, under scarcity conditions and climate change considerable effort has been devoted over time to introduce policies aiming to increase water efficiency based on the assertion that more can be achieved with less water through better management. Better management usually refers to improvement of water allocation and/or irrigation water efficiency. The former is closely related to adequate pricing, while the latter depends on the type of irrigation technology, environmental conditions and the scheduling of water application. Agricultural practices, such as soil management, irrigation and fertilizer application and disease and pest control are related with the sustainable water management in agriculture and protection of the environment. Socio-economic pressures and climate change impose restrictions to water allocated to agriculture. The adoption of sustainable water management in Mediterranean is not only a technological problem but involves many other considerations relative to social behavior of rural communities, the economic constrains, or the legal and institutional framework that may favor the adoption of some measures and not others. Sustainable water management in agriculture, which has a multi-functional role in Southern Europe, can be achieved by adopting improvements in irrigation application, soil and plant practices, water pricing, reuse of treated wastewater, farmers' participation in water management and capacity building.},

In our region the soil structure and the orchards slope, vegetation, depending on the year, to a loss of between 40-100 tons per hectare. Soil processing by lose ground is important for quantities of soil and water losses in every year. The importance of the land in agricultural production processing topics, manufacturers, increases productivity with timely and accurate processing of applications on soil. In addition to the increase in the efficiency of handling soil erosion by the soil protection and control of soil water contents are benefits such as to conservation. In this study, tillage, reduced tillage in dry farming areas, mulching and soil moisture content will rely upon.},

@article{aukerStatisticalAnalysisGlobal2013,
	abstract = {A new database of volcanic fatalities is presented and analysed, covering the period 1600 to 2010 AD. Data are from four sources: the Smithsonian Institution, Witham (2005), CRED EM-DAT and Munich RE. The data were combined and formatted, with a weighted average fatality figure used where more than one source reports an event; the former two databases were weighted twice as strongly as the latter two. More fatal incidents are contained within our database than similar previous works; approximately 46\% of the fatal incidents are listed in only one of the four sources, and fewer than 10\% are in all four. 278,880 fatalities are recorded in the database, resultant from 533 fatal incidents. The fatality count is dominated by a handful of disasters, though the majority of fatal incidents have caused fewer than ten fatalities. Number and empirical probability of fatalities are broadly correlated with VEI, but are more strongly influenced by population density around volcanoes and the occurrence and extent of lahars (mudflows) and pyroclastic density currents, which have caused 50\% of fatalities. Indonesia, the Philippines, and the West Indies dominate the spatial distribution of fatalities, and there is some negative correlation between regional development and number of fatalities. With the largest disasters removed, over 90\% of fatalities occurred between 5 km and 30 km from volcanoes, though the most devastating eruptions impacted far beyond these distances. A new measure, the Volcano Fatality Index, is defined to explore temporal changes in societal vulnerability to volcanic hazards. The measure incorporates population growth and recording improvements with the fatality data, and shows prima facie evidence that vulnerability to volcanic hazards has fallen during the last two centuries. Results and interpretations are limited in scope by the underlying fatalities data, which are affected by under-recording, uncertainty, and bias. Attempts have been made to estimate the extent of these issues, and to remove their effects where possible.},

@article{aronTripleOxygenIsotopes2021,
	abstract = {The past decade has seen a remarkable expansion of studies that use mass-dependent variations of triple oxygen isotopes (16O, 17O, 18O) in isotope hydrology and isotope geochemistry. Recent technological and analytical advances demonstrate that small deviations of 18O and 17O from a mass-dependent reference relationship are systematic and are explained by well-known equilibrium and kinetic fractionations. Measurements of 18O and 17O complement traditional metrics like deuterium-excess, constrain isotope effects of kinetic fractionation that are impossible to discern with 18O alone, and help reconstruct past environmental conditions from geologic records. In this review, we synthesize published meteoric (derived from precipitation) water triple oxygen isotope data with a new, near-global surface water dataset of 18O, 17O, 2H, deuterium-excess, and ∆17O, where ∆17O is defined as 17O -- ref 18O,  notation is a logarithmic definition of the common  value (=ln( + 1), and ref is equal to 0.528. The expanded dataset shows that meteoric water 18O and 17O fit multiple regression lines and indicates that one global meteoric water line does not adequately describe all triple oxygen isotope data. Instead, this isotope system may be sensitive to processes such as moisture transport, rainout, and evaporation that do not affect the water cycle equally across the globe. This review provides a practical guide to understand ∆17O variation in waters, explains the utility of this isotope system in hydrologic and paleoclimate studies, and outlines directions of future work that will expand the use of ∆17O.},

@article{archerAtmosphericLifetimeFossil2009,
	abstract = {CO2 released from combustion of fossil fuels equilibrates among the various carbon reservoirs of the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere on timescales of a few centuries. However, a sizeable fraction of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere, awaiting a return to the solid earth by much slower weathering processes and deposition of CaCO3. Common measures of the atmospheric lifetime of CO2, including the e-folding time scale, disregard the long tail. Its neglect in the calculation of global warming potentials leads many to underestimate the longevity of anthropogenic global warming. Here, we review the past literature on the atmospheric lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 and its impact on climate, and we present initial results from a model intercomparison project on this topic. The models agree that 20--35\% of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere after equilibration with the ocean (2--20 centuries). Neutralization by CaCO3 draws the airborne fraction down further on timescales of 3 to 7 kyr.},

@article{anhaeusserArchaeanGreenstoneBelts2014,
	abstract = {Archaean greenstone belts and associated granitic rocks comprise some of the most diverse rock types on the Earth's surface and were formed during the early stages of the development of the planet from Eoarchaean to Neoarchaean times -- a period extending back from about 4000 to 2500 million years ago. Because of their great age, these rocks have received unprecedented attention from a wide spectrum of Earth scientists striving to learn more about the evolution of the Earth, including its crust, hydrosphere, atmosphere, the commencement of life, and the nature and distribution of mineral deposits. The knowledge gained thus far has accumulated incrementally, beginning with solid field-based studies, the latter being supplemented with increasingly advanced technological developments that have enabled scientists to probe fundamental questions of Earth history. Archaean granite-greenstone terranes display considerable variability of lithologies and geotectonic events, yet there are unifying characteristics that distinguish them from other geological environments. Most greenstone belts consist of a wide variety of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that reflect different evolutionary conditions of formation and all have invariably been influenced by subsequent geotectonic factors, including the intrusion of ultramafic, mafic and granitic complexes, resulting in widespread deformation, metamorphism, metasomatism, as well as mineralization. Geochemical and isotopic age determinations have shown how complex these ancient rocks are and efforts at understanding the nature and evolution of the hydrosphere, atmosphere and primitive life have made Archaean terranes exciting environments in which to study. Conflicting views as to the nature, history and origin of many of the rock types and events in Archaean terranes has been ongoing and stimulating. This review attempts to describe the main lithotypes and other characteristics of granite-greenstone belt geology and points to some areas where contrasting views have been expressed.},

@article{andrewsIcebergsIcebergRafted2000,
	abstract = {Over the last decade considerable attention has been given to evidence for the iceberg rafting of sediments into the North Atlantic, especially during Heinrich (H) events (presumed to be associated with short-lived, abrupt intervals of increased iceberg and meltwater flux). However, our knowledge of the present sediment distribution within icebergs and the fate of this sediment during iceberg drift is rudimentary. Debris is usually concentrated in a 1 3 m layer at the base of a glacier ; if present in calved icebergs, this layer is rapidly melted within a few 10s to 100s of km from an ice margin. Ice rafted debris (IRD) is frequently characterized by the weight percentage or counts of mineral grains within certain size fractions (i.e. {\textgreater} 63, {\textgreater} 250 Fun, etc.) with an implicit assumption that the selection of the size limits does not bias the data nor their interpretation. However, studies of glacial and glacial marine sediments indicate there is a poor correlation between the weight percentage in different sand-size classes, moreover, the bulk of glacially derived sediments are typically silts and clays ({\textless} 63 Fun). In areas close to the probable sources of iceberg discharge during Heinrich events, the abrupt changes are poorly defined by the sand-size IRD fraction but are dramatically highlighted by the input of fine-grained ({\textless} 63 Fun) detrital carbonate. During the last glaciation, abrupt changes in IRD concentrations (IRD spikes) appear to be an important feature of the mid-latitude belt of the North Atlantic, whereas at higher latitudes, such as areas of the Labrador and Nordic seas, IRD input was more continuous and individual H-events cannot be identified solely by their IRD signal.},

@article{andrewsHoloceneStableIsotope2020,
	abstract = {We explore Holocene climatic changes recorded by geochemical proxies in a single, well-dated, stalagmite from the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran, a region where stalagmite records have so far only provided short glimpses of Holocene climatic changes. Stalagmite KT-3 from Katalekhor Cave began growing ∼9.5 ka under wet early Holocene conditions coincident with the timing of Sapropel 1. At this time δ18O values were at or below −9.0‰, stalagmite growth diameter was at its maximum, 234U/238U0 activity values were low and trace element contents indicate flushing of the epikarst. Progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount after 7.0 ka, is recorded by increasing δ18O and 234U/238U0 activity values and reduction in trace element contents and growth diameter until ∼2.0 ka. These trends follow the reduction in summer insolation and agree with model-simulated changes in total rainfall and rainwater isotopes. Sub-centennial-scale variability is not a feature of the δ18O or trace element records; this suggests a stable winter recharge regime, a feature that might militate against KT-3 δ18O recording changes in the seasonality of rainfall. KT-3 δ13C compositions are enriched relative to lower altitude stalagmites in the Levant, implying low soil CO2 contribution (thin montane soils). However, a broadly decreasing millennial-scale trend in δ13C suggests that soil carbon contributions increased with time despite the progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount. The δ13C changes probably reflect decreasing summer temperatures and less extreme wintertime coldness, driven by reducing summer- and increasing winter-insolation respectively. These combined effects decreased effective evaporation and improved soil-moisture availability favouring vegetation development during the growth season. The δ13C values also show ∼1.5‰ centennial-scale variability with higher δ13C values between 9.0 and 8.7 ka, 8.3--7.7 ka, 6.5--5.5 ka, 5.4--4.5 ka and ∼4.3--2.0 ka: three of these correspond with Rapid Climate Change (RCC) events based on non-seasalt potassium (K+) in Greenland ice cores. Higher δ13C values indicate poor soil development caused by aridity. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly (8.3--7.7 ka) is in part overprinted by the ∼160 year-long, 8.2 ka cold/dry event, but culmination ∼7.7 ka corresponds with other records suggesting an intensified Siberian High Pressure system affecting regional climate. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly between 4.3 and 2.0 ka overlaps the 2.65 to 2.50 ka `Assyrian megadrought' evident in stalagmite stable isotope records in northern Iraq. The KT-3 record is key in better understanding Holocene climate change in the central Zagros region, representative of montane `fertile crescent' environments.},

Considerable amounts of the greenhouse gas methane leak from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain. Alvarez et al. reassessed the magnitude of this leakage and found that in 2015, supply chain emissions were ∼60\% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate. They suggest that this discrepancy exists because current inventory methods miss emissions that occur during abnormal operating conditions. These data, and the methodology used to obtain them, could improve and verify international inventories of greenhouse gases and provide a better understanding of mitigation efforts outlined by the Paris Agreement.
Science, this issue p. 186
Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for {\textasciitilde}30\% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 $\pm$ 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3\% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is {\textasciitilde}60\% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO2 from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.
Methane leakage from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain is much greater than previously estimated.

	abstract = {Evidence from the magnetic field fossilized in sedimentary rocks suggests that, more than 600 million years ago, ice occupied tropical latitudes. A popular explanation for these findings, the Snowball Earth concept, envisages a fully frozen Earth for millions of years, caused by a runaway ice--albedo feedback. A rapid, catastrophic meltback at very high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide is thought to have ended this extreme climatic state. However, sedimentary rocks deposited during these cold intervals indicate that dynamic glaciers and ice streams continued to deliver large amounts of sediment to open oceans throughout the glacial cycle. The sedimentary evidence therefore indicates that despite the severity of glaciation, some oceans must have remained ice-free. Significant areas of open ocean have important implications for the survival and diversification of life and for the workings of the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Clumped isotopes geochemistry measures the thermodynamic preference of two heavy, rare, isotopes to bind with each other. This preference is temperature dependent, and is more pronounced at low temperatures. Carbonate clumped isotope values are independent of the carbonate 813C and 8180, making them independent of the carbon or oxygen composition of the solution from which the carbonate precipitated. At equilibrium, it is therefore a direct proxy for the temperature in which the carbonate mineral formed. In most cases, carbonate clumped isotopes record the temperature of carbonate formation, irrespective of the mineral form (calcite, aragonite, or bioapatite) or the organism making it. The carbonate formation temperatures obtained from carbonate clumped isotope analysis can be used in conjunction with the 8180 of the same carbonate, to constrain the oxygen isotope composition of the water from which the carbonate has precipitated. There are, however, cases of deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium, where both clumped and oxygen isotopes are offset from the expected values. Such carbonates must be characterized and calibrated separately. For deep-time applications, special care must be paid to the preservation of the original signal, in particular with respect to diagenetic alteration associated with atomic scale diffusion that may be undetectable by common tests for diagenesis.},

@article{adolphiConnectingGreenlandIcecore2018,
	abstract = {Abstract. During the last glacial period Northern Hemisphere climate was characterized
by extreme and abrupt climate changes, so-called Dansgaard--Oeschger (DO)
events. Most clearly observed as temperature changes in Greenland ice-core
records, their climatic imprint was geographically widespread. However, the
temporal relation between DO events in Greenland and other regions is
uncertain due to the chronological uncertainties of each archive, limiting
our ability to test hypotheses of synchronous change. In contrast, the
assumption of direct synchrony of climate changes forms the basis of many
timescales. Here, we use cosmogenic radionuclides (10Be,
36Cl, 14C) to link Greenland ice-core records to
U∕Th-dated speleothems, quantify offsets between the two timescales, and
improve their absolute dating back to 45 000 years ago. This approach allows
us to test the assumption that DO events occurred synchronously between
Greenland ice-core and tropical speleothem records with unprecedented
precision. We find that the onset of DO events occurs within synchronization
uncertainties in all investigated records. Importantly, we demonstrate that
local discrepancies remain in the temporal development of rapid climate
change for specific events and speleothems. These may either be related to
the location of proxy records relative to the shifting atmospheric fronts or
to underestimated U∕Th dating uncertainties. Our study thus highlights
the potential for misleading interpretations of the Earth system when
applying the common practice of climate wiggle matching.},

For the past 12,560 years, the radiocarbon calibration curve is constrained by high quality tree-ring data. Prior to this, however, its uncertainties increase rapidly due to the absence of suitable tree-ring 14C data. Here, we present new high-resolution 14C measurements from 3 floating tree-ring chronologies from the last deglaciation. By using combined information from the current radiocarbon calibration curve and ice core 10Be records, we are able to absolutely date these chronologies at high confidence. We show that our data imply large 14C-age variations during the B{\o}lling chronozone (Greenland Interstadial 1e) -- a period that is currently characterized by a long 14C-age plateau in the most recent IntCal13 calibration record. We demonstrate that this lack of structure in IntCal13 may currently lead to erroneous calibrated ages by up to 500 years.},

@article{adolphiSynchronizingGreenlandIce2016,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Investigations of past climate dynamics rely on accurate and precise chronologies of the employed climate reconstructions. The radiocarbon dating calibration curve (IntCal13) and the Greenland ice core chronology (GICC05) represent two of the most widely used chronological frameworks in paleoclimatology of the past ∼ 50 000 years. However, comparisons of climate records anchored on these chronologies are hampered by the precision and accuracy of both timescales. Here we use common variations in the production rates of $^{\textrm{14}}$C and $^{\textrm{10}}$Be recorded in tree-rings and ice cores, respectively, to assess the differences between both timescales during the Holocene. Compared to earlier work, we employ a novel statistical approach which leads to strongly reduced and yet, more robust, uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inferred timescale differences are robust independent of (i) the applied ice core $^{\textrm{10}}$Be records, (ii) assumptions of the mode of $^{\textrm{10}}$Be deposition, as well as (iii) carbon cycle effects on $^{\textrm{14}}$C, and (iv) in agreement with independent estimates of the timescale differences. Our results imply that the GICC05 counting error is likely underestimated during the most recent 2000 years leading to a dating bias that propagates throughout large parts of the Holocene. Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that the GICC05 counting error is generally a robust uncertainty measurement but care has to be taken when treating it as a nearly Gaussian error distribution. The proposed IntCal13-GICC05 transfer function facilitates the comparison of ice core and radiocarbon dated paleoclimate records at high chronological precision.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our understanding of the relationship between circulation and climate in the past allows us to predict the impact of future climate-driven circulation changes. One proposed tracer of past ocean circulation is the neodymium isotope composition (εNd) of ancient water masses. However, ambiguities in what governs the εNd distribution in the modern ocean hamper interpretations of this tracer. Here we present εNd values for marine pore fluids, sediments, and the overlying water column for three sites in the North Pacific. We find that ocean bottom water εNd (εNdBW) in the northeast Pacific lies between the value expected for the water mass (--3.3) and the measured εNd of sediment pore fluid (εNdPW;--1.8). Moreover, εNdPW resembles the εNd of the sediment. Combined, these findings are consistent with recent assessments that sediment pore fluids may be a major source of rare earth elements to the ocean and suggest that the benthic flux of Nd from pore fluids exerts the primary control over the deep ocean distribution of εNd.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing the dynamic response of the Antarctic ice sheets to warming during the Last Glacial Termination (LGT; 18,000--11,650 yrs ago) allows us to disentangle ice-climate feedbacks that are key to improving future projections. Whilst the sequence of events during this period is reasonably well-known, relatively poor chronological control has precluded precise alignment of ice, atmospheric and marine records, making it difficult to assess relationships between Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) dynamics, climate change and sea level. Here we present results from a highly-resolved `horizontal ice core' from the Weddell Sea Embayment, which records millennial-scale AIS dynamics across this extensive region. Counterintuitively, we find AIS mass-loss across the full duration of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14,600--12,700 yrs ago), with stabilisation during the subsequent millennia of atmospheric warming. Earth-system and ice-sheet modelling suggests these contrasting trends were likely Antarctic-wide, sustained by feedbacks amplified by the delivery of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf. Given the anti-phase relationship between inter-hemispheric climate trends across the LGT our findings demonstrate that Southern Ocean-AIS feedbacks were controlled by global atmospheric teleconnections. With increasing stratification of the Southern Ocean and intensification of mid-latitude westerly winds today, such teleconnections could amplify AIS mass loss and accelerate global sea-level rise.},

D--O variability included changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), temperature changes of opposite sign and asynchronous timing in each hemisphere, shifts in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and variations in atmospheric CO2. Palaeorecords and numerical studies indicate that the AMOC, with a tight coupling to Nordic Seas sea ice, is central to D--O variability, yet, a complete theory remains elusive. In this Review, we synthesize the climatic expression and processes proposed to explain D--O cyclicity. What emerges is an oscillatory framework of the AMOC--sea-ice system, arising through feedbacks involving the atmosphere, cryosphere and the Earth's biogeochemical system. Palaeoclimate observations indicate that the AMOC might be more sensitive to perturbations than climate models currently suggest. Tighter constraints on AMOC stability are, thus, needed to project AMOC changes over the coming century as a response to anthropogenic carbon emissions. Progress can be achieved by additional observational constraints and numerical simulations performed with coupled climate--ice-s heet models.},

Here, we set out to elucidate the underlying dynamics by conducting a transient global hindcast simulation with a 3-D intermediate complexity earth system model covering the period 50 to 30 ka BP. The model is forced by time-varying external boundary conditions (greenhouse gases, orbital forcing, and ice-sheet orography and albedo) and anomalous North Atlantic freshwater fluxes, which mimic the effects of changing northern hemispheric ice volume on millennial timescales. Together these forcings generate a realistic global climate trajectory, as demonstrated by an extensive model/paleo data comparison. Our results are consistent with the idea that variations in ice-sheet calving and subsequent changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation were the main drivers for the continuum of glacial millennial-scale variability seen in paleorecords across the globe.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{dissardImpactSalinityMg2010,
	abstract = {Over the last decade, sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructed from the Mg/Ca ratio of foraminiferal calcite has increasingly been used, in combination with the d18O signal measured on the same material, to calculate the d18Ow, a proxy for sea surface salinity (SSS). A number of studies, however, have shown that the Mg/Ca ratio is also sensitive to other parameters, such as pH or ½CO32{\`A}, and salinity. To increase the reliability of foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios as temperature proxies, these effects should be quantified in isolation. Individuals of the benthic foraminifera Ammonia tepida were cultured at three different salinities (20, 33 and 40 psu) and two temperatures (10--15 $\,^{\circ}$C). The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of newly formed calcite were analyzed by Laser Ablation ICP-MS and demonstrate that the Mg concentration in A. tepida is overall relatively low (mean value per experimental condition between 0.5 and 1.3 mmol/mol) when compared to other foraminiferal species, Sr being similar to other foraminiferal species. The Mg and Sr incorporation are both enhanced with increasing temperatures. However, the temperature dependency for Sr disappears when the distribution factor DSr is plotted as a function of calcite saturation state (X). This suggests that a kinetic process related to X is responsible for the observed dependency of Sr incorporation on sea water temperature. The inferred relative increase in DMg per unit salinity is 2.8\% at 10 $\,^{\circ}$C and 3.3\% at 15 $\,^{\circ}$C, for the salinity interval 20--40 psu. This implies that a salinity increase of 2 psu results in enhanced Mg incorporation equivalent to 1 $\,^{\circ}$C temperature increase. The DSr increase per unit salinity is 0.8\% at 10 $\,^{\circ}$C and 1.3\% at 15 $\,^{\circ}$C, for the salinity interval 20--40 psu.},

@article{fordSustainedMidPlioceneWarmth2022,
	abstract = {Geologic intervals of sustained warmth such as the mid-Pliocene Warm Period can inform our understanding of future climate change, including the long-term consequences of oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon. Here we generate carbon isotope records and synthesize existing records to reconstruct the position of water masses and determine circulation patterns in the deep Pacific Ocean. We show that the mid-depth carbon isotope gradient in the North Pacific was reversed during the mid-Pliocene compared with today, which implies water flowed from north to south and deep water probably formed in the subarctic North Pacific Deep Water. An isotopically enabled climate model that simulates this North Pacific Deep Water reproduces a similar carbon isotope pattern. Modelled levels of dissolved inorganic carbon content in the North Pacific decrease slightly, although the amount of carbon stored in the ocean actually increases by 1.6\% relative to modern due to an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface ocean. Although the modelled Pliocene ocean maintains a carbon budget similar to the present, the change in deep ocean circulation configuration causes pronounced downstream changes in biogeochemistry.},

@book{badianeTheoryPracticeAgriculture2014,
	abstract = {Abstract: Africa's improved growth performance over the last 15 years provides an opportunity for the continent to transit from recovery to structural transformation. This paper reviews the evolution of development theory and practice, the role of agriculture therein, and the pace of structural transformation in Africa over the last 50 years. The evolution has involved shifting roles of industry vs. agriculture and that of government, and the public sector vs. markets and the private sector. Government intervention in favour of industrialization in the 1960s-1970s resulted in the neglect of agriculture, poor growth performance, and a productivity-reducing structural transformation, characterized by an increasing concentration of low productivity labour in the informal service sector. The paper suggests a move away from the dual-economy to a three-dimensional model that pays greater attention to the large informal segment of the service sector. A successful transformation will require accelerated agricultural productivity growth, a modernized informal service sector, and effective industrialization strategies, with balanced roles for government, markets, and the private sector, all supported by country-led, evidence-based strategies exemplified under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).},

@article{muriithiInformationTechnologyAgriculture2009,
	abstract = {Access, efficiency and affordability of agricultural information continue to be a major impediment for raising agricultural productivity among smallholders in Africa. Recently information and communication technology (ICT) has provided a possible pathway to ameliorate this scenario. A variety of innovations that integrate ICTs into the dissemination of agricultural information to farmers (Farmers Information Services --FIS) have been developed at local, national and regional levels. They have currently demonstrated a promising field of new research and application in e-agriculture whilst bringing new sources of information and new tools for local knowledge dissemination. This paper reviews and discusses the role of ICT and its practical contributions to agriculture and rural development in Kenya. Data from various sources- Kenya's agricultural departments, ICT providers, NGOs and grey literature reviews were used. Results indicate use of ICTs especially mobile telephones is currently widespread in the rural areas of Kenya. Approximately one member of smallholder farming households own mobile phones. Extension service providers have harnessed this technology by putting it into profitable use in rural Kenya. For example, Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange (KACE) has developed a short messaging service- SMS SOKONI in partnership with Safaricom mobile phone provider. Any farmer anywhere in the country can access updated and reliable market information on prices and commodity offers at an affordable rate using their mobile phones. So far, the service is easy to use, reliable, convenient and affordable. The average monthly usage of this service increased from 1,273 in 2006 to 24,716 in 2008, demonstrating its subsequent usefulness and eagerness of farmers to explore the market information and linkage systems. Farmers are also able to access information on the right Hybrid Maize seeds to plant in their respective agroecological zones by way of texting to Kenya Seed Company Ltd a major seed distributor in East African region. This paper recommends adoption of such technologies by institutions such as Metrological Department to enhance provision of updated data on climate for appropriate decision making by agricultural farmers. This paper is critical to enhancing awareness on appropriate transferable technologies of 21st century that are still compatible to diverse cultural perceptions.},

	abstract = {In a world increasingly challenged by the need to integrate and understand highly specialized knowledge in a multidisciplinary way, this book is innovative and perhaps unique in addressing this challenge. It focuses on ideas, strategies, techniques and practices spanning many disciplines at the interface of agriculture with: forestry, horticulture, plant physiology, genetics, ecology, soil science, food science, economics, and the social and environmental sciences as delivered by intensified and enriched agroforestry. Multifunctional Agriculture addresses this complexity, using case studies and insights from the needs of African farmers whose livelihoods are constrained by complex interactions between social, environmental and economic factors and problems underlying agricultural sustainability in Africa. This book, therefore, provides an important resource for those trying to understand the role of agriculture in the achievement of the new Sustainable Development Goals by providing easily implementable, practical and effective methodologies and practices.  Provides a single-source, comprehensive insight into agroforestry/ multifunctional agriculture, it's potential, challenges, and progress Helps readers understand and assess potential opportunity through implementation Includes case studies and real-world insights that address common situations and the practical application of best practices Explores the role of multi-functional agriculture in mitigating climate change impacts, providing value-story beyond crop production},

However, in response to recent skepticism, this paper examines whether the conventional wisdom about agriculture's contribution to the development process can still be applied to Africa today. We first outline the debate between the proponents of agriculture and its skeptics before presenting a series of case studies reflecting the heterogeneity of initial conditions facing low-income African countries. Drawing on economy-wide modeling, these case studies contrast the effectiveness of alternative growth strategies in reducing poverty. The findings indicate that while Africa does face many new challenges unlike those faced by Asian countries, there is little evidence to suggest that these countries can bypass a broad-based agricultural revolution to successfully launch their economic transformations.},

@article{osabohienAgricultureDevelopmentEmployment2019,
	abstract = {Background: The problem of poverty eradication has been limited to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region, which accounts for more than 40\% of the world's poor population. The majority of these people are rural farmers who depend solely on agriculture for livelihood. Agriculture in West Africa remains the largest means of employment in which more than 60\% of the sub-region's active labour force is involved.
Objective: This study examined the potentials of agriculture to generate employment for the people, thereby reducing the level of poverty in West Africa.
Methods: The Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) econometric technique was employed in this study for the panel data covering the period of 17 years (2000 to 2016).
Results: Results from the study showed that agriculture provides the opportunity for the poor to increase their earnings to escape the poverty trap, whether the poor can seize these agricultural opportunities depends on their human capital development.
Conclusion: The study, therefore, concluded that effective policies (e.g. social protection) should be formulated in the agricultural development plans that will prioritize sustainable land and water management, access to markets, and the food security. To achieve this, the use of modern methods should be encouraged through farm incentives to boost agricultural production and increase farmer's income which is earned through the sale of agricultural commodities, and thus; in the long run, increase the revenue accruing to the government and reduce the rate of poverty.},

@article{marchittoImprovedOxygenIsotope2014,
	abstract = {Despite decades of use as a paleoceanographic proxy, considerable uncertainty still surrounds the temperature dependence of benthic foraminiferal δ18O. Widely applied paleotemperature equations may mix non-equilibrium foraminifera with equilibrium synthetic calcite, resulting in temperature sensitivities that are too large. Warm-water foraminiferal calibrations may give temperature sensitivities that are too small for very cold waters. Here we combine new core top measurements from the Florida Straits and the Arctic Ocean with published data to derive new δ18O:temperature relationships for three groups of benthic foraminifera. We derive a quadratic equation for Cibicidoides and Planulina that agrees well with equilibrium synthetic calcite, and that should be applicable over all oceanographic temperatures. We find that Uvigerina is not at equilibrium and is isotopically heavier than Cibicidoides and Planulina by 0.47‰, in contrast to the historically used 0.64‰. Hoeglundina elegans is further enriched and appears to be slightly heavier than equilibrium aragonite. Finally we discuss the implications of the Florida Straits observations for the hypothesis that benthic foraminifera precipitate their shells from a pH-dependent mixture of bicarbonate and carbonate ions.},

@article{brennanPatternsMechanismsNortheast2022,
	abstract = {Ocean-atmosphere dynamics in the north Pacific play an important role in the global climate system and influence hydroclimate in western North America. However, changes to this region's mean climate under increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are not well understood. Here we present new alkenone-based records of sea surface temperature (SST) from the northeast Pacific from the mid-Piacenzian warm period (approximately 3.3--3.0 Ma), an interval considered to be an analog for near-future climate under middle-of-the-road anthropogenic emissions. We compare these and other alkenone-based SST records from the north Pacific to fully-coupled climate model simulations to examine the impact of mid-Pliocene CO2 and other boundary conditions on regional climate dynamics and to explore factors governing model disagreement about regional temperature patterns. Model performance varies regionally, with Community Earth System Model 1.2 (CESM 1.2) and CESM2 performing best in regions with greater warming like the California Margin, though these models underestimate the warming evidenced in our new proxy record and others from the region. Single forcing simulations reveal a strong influence for prescribed land surface changes and higher CO2 levels on coastal warming patterns along the California Margin in CESM2. Furthermore, differences in shortwave and longwave radiation and circulation between the models, likely related to changes in the atmospheric component of the model, may play a key role in the ability of models to capture regionally-varying patterns of Pliocene warmth. Regional patterns of temperature change inferred from geochemical records could therefore help to understand the impacts of different model parameterization schemes on regional climate patterns.},

@article{bentovImpactBiomineralizationProcesses2006,
	abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio in foraminiferal shells is widely used as a proxy for paleotemperatures. Nevertheless, it seems that the basic Mg content of foraminifera is determined by biological factors, as can be concluded from the large inter species and intrashell variability and the frequent deviations from inorganic behavior. This paper discusses three possible ways by which foraminifera can control or modify the Mg content in their shell: (1) involvement of organic matrix in the precipitation process that may alter the partition coefficient of Mg in biogenic calcite, (2) controlled conversion of transient amorphous phases to calcite, and (3) modification of the Mg concentration in the parent solution from which the crystals precipitate. The first two mechanisms are probably responsible for the precipitation of high-Mg calcite phases (whole shell or sublayers), while the third mechanism leads to the formation of low-Mg calcite phases. We propose a model adapted from epithelial cells that allows massive Mg2+ removal from the biomineralization site. This model is especially relevant to the planktonic and deep benthic low-Mg foraminifera that are frequently used for paleotemperature reconstructions. We discuss the possible biological roles of Mg in the shell in terms of the calcite polymorph conservation, the in vivo chemical stability of the shell, the functions of Mg as a stabilizer of transient phases and as a controlling agent of the precipitation process. Several temperature sensitive biological processes that may influence the Mg/Ca ratio of the shell are suggested and a model that combines biogenic and inorganic considerations is presented. The model uses Mg heterogeneity in the shell together with temperature response (biologic and inorganic) of biomineralization processes, to account for the deviation of planktonic foraminifera from inorganic calcite at equilibrium with seawater.},

@article{chivasMagnesiumContentNonmarine1986,
	abstract = {Ostracods are microcrustaceans with calcitic carapaces (each consisting of two valves or shells) that grow by moulting and regeneration of sequentially larger valves up to nine times before reaching maturity. The Mg content of these valves is species-dependent and is a function of their growth stage and the temperature, salinity, Mg content and Mg/Ca ratio of their host water. Newly formed, partly calcified valves of the non-marine nektic ostracod Mytilocypris henricae have high Mg contents (100,000 ppm Mg in CaCO3 at individual shell weights of 2 μg). This relative Mg content decreases as calcification proceeds, until shell weights exceed 120 μg, whereupon the Mg content is constant and useful as an indicator of the ostracod's environment. Mg/Ca ratios in individual ostracod valves from several species of the genera Mytilocypris and Australocypris from culture experiments and a series of Australian lakes indicate that the valve's Mg content increases as a function of increasing temperature and salinity. Within the range 11--25$\,^{\circ}$C and for waters containing 24--2325 ppm Mg, the molar Mg/Ca ratio in these ostracods' fully calcified valves increases by 0.0015 (or 370 ppm Mg in CaCO3) per 1$\,^{\circ}$C and per change of 125 ppm Mg in solution. For most mainland Australian lakes, a change in water composition of 125 ppm Mg corresponds to a change of 3.5‰ in salinity. For a given Mg content of a lake, the Mg/Ca ratio of the water may vary within the range of common lacustrine values without significantly affecting Mg uptake in the ostracod valves. These relationships can provide palaeosalinities and/or palaeotemperatures for ostracods recovered from continental sediments. For Mg partitioning, an increase in temperature and salinity produce increased Mg content in ostracods, whereas for 18O fractionation in biogenic calcite an increase in temperature produces a decrease in δ18O of the ostracod and an increase in salinity leads to an increase in δ18O of the ostracod. Thus a combination of δ18O and Mg measurements on non-marine ostracods should enable unique resolution of palaeotemperature and palaeosalinity variations.},

@article{elmoreGlobalEvaluationTemperature2012,
	abstract = {Improving estimates of past ocean temperatures is paramount to our understanding of ocean circulation and its role in climate change. Magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios of carapaces of the benthic ostracod genus Krithe were determined from new, globally distributed core top samples from the Norwegian Sea, Cape Hatteras shelf, Gulf of Mexico, Sulawesi Margin (Indonesia), New Zealand shelf, Ceara Rise, and the North Atlantic. A linear regression of the Krithe Mg/Ca ratios and bottom water temperature (BWT) reveals a significant correlation for locations where temperature during carapace calcification was above ∼3$\,^{\circ}$C, which can be described by the equation Mg/Ca = (0.972 $\pm$ 0.152) * BWT + (7.948 $\pm$ 1.103) consistent with previous North Atlantic calibrations. Deviations from the global calibration line below ∼3$\,^{\circ}$C follow the same pattern observed for benthic foraminifera, suggesting that the incorporation of magnesium into ostracodal calcite may be secondarily controlled by changes in carbonate ion concentration. Therefore, we propose a linear regression that describes the relationship between magnesium incorporation, temperature, and carbonate saturation for low temperatures ({\textless}3$\,^{\circ}$C); Mg/Ca = (0.972 $\pm$ 0.152) * BWT + (0.100 $\pm$ 0.030) * Δ[CO32−]) + (4.440 $\pm$ 1.103) (1 SE = $\pm$ 0.3$\,^{\circ}$C). While the standard error of the calibration is small, it requires an accurate knowledge of past Δ[CO32−] concentration, which necessitates additional proxy data. Applying the calibration to glacial samples from the deep North Atlantic Ocean we show that estimates of bottom water temperatures generated from the new Δ[CO32−]- corrected equations are more consistent with results from oxygen isotopes and pore water studies.},

	abstract = {Processes relating to the formation of dense shelf water and intermediate water in the Okhotsk Sea were studied by examining oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O), salinity, and temperature. The salinity and δ18O of the cold dense shelf water on the northern continental shelf showed peculiar relationship. The relationship indicates that 3\% of the mixed-layer water, having salinity of 32.6, froze and the remaining 97\% became dense shelf water of salinities of more than 33.2 (σθ{\textgreater}26.7) during the sea ice formation. The salinity--δ18O relationship also shows that 20\% of the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water at the σθ=26.8 level was derived from the dense shelf water. The remaining 80\% came from the Western Subarctic Pacific water modified by diapycnal mixing of water affected by the surface cooling and freshening within the Okhotsk Sea. The mixing with dense shelf water contributes to only 26\% of the temperature difference or 8\% of the salinity difference between the original Pacific water and the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water at σθ=26.8. This result suggests that the cold and less saline properties of the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water are produced mainly by diapycnal mixing, rather than by mixing of the Pacific water with the dense shelf water.},

Interpretation of δ18Ocvariability typically neglects changes due to factors other than ice volume and temperature. Here we investigate whether glacial-interglacial changes in sea ice, which fractionates seawater during its formation, could shift the isotopic value of seawater---in the deep ocean (affecting benthic foraminiferal δ18Oc and thereby potentially impacting oxygen isotope based sea level reconstructions) or in surface waters (affecting planktic foraminiferal δ18Oc). We simulate glacial and interglacial states with the isotope-enabled University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model and perform a global analysis. Distinct patterns of sea ice production emerge for the glacial versus interglacial states. We find no substantive shift in δ18Ow in model deep or bottom waters due to the simulated interglacial-glacial sea ice variability. Small isotopic shifts due to sea ice variability are concentrated in the model's surface waters of the Northern Hemisphere, specifically in the Labrador Sea and northeastern North Atlantic.},

@article{conroyConstraintsSalinityOxygen2014,
	abstract = {Uncertainties surround the relationship between salinity and the stable isotopic composition of seawater, largely due to a dearth of modern seawater isotope data. Here we report 191 new, paired measurements of salinity and seawater oxygen isotopes (δ18Osw) taken from the central tropical Pacific in May 2012, from the surface to 4600 m depth. We observe significant correlations between δ18Osw and salinity across the study region, with slopes ranging from 0.23 to 0.31‰/psu for the mixed layer, and 0.35--0.42‰/psu for waters between the mixed layer and 500 m depth. When considering δ18Osw--salinity across averages of individual water masses in the region, slopes range from 0.21 to 0.40‰/psu, albeit with appreciable scatter. Surface salinity and δ18Osw data corresponding to the North Equatorial Countercurrent are significantly higher than previously observed, which we attribute to a weak westerly current and dry conditions in the region during the May 2012 cruise. Subsurface (80--500 m) salinity values from 2012 are significantly lower than corresponding values from pre-existing regional data, highlighting a different latitudinal sampling distribution, while subsurface δ18Osw is not significantly different. Thus, in May 2012, δ18Osw in this region could not be used to distinguish between subsurface water masses of different salinities. Unlike other regions where the surface `freshwater endmember' is close to the δ18O value of regional precipitation, the freshwater endmember implied by our dataset (−10.38‰) is consistent with a strong evaporative influence. Paired δ18O--δD values of precipitation and surface seawaters have similar slopes (5.0, 5.1), and relatively low intercepts (1.4, 0.8) indicating isotopic variability in both reservoirs is also partly controlled by evaporation.},

The most recent of these oscillations, also found in continental pollen records, has greatest impact in the area under the meteorological influence of the northern Atlantic, but none in the United States. This suggests that these oscillations are caused by fluctuations in the formation rate of deep water in the northern Atlantic. As the present production of deep water in this area is driven by an excess of evaporation over precipitation and continental runoff, atmospheric water transport may be an important element in climate change. Changes in the production rate of deep water in this sector of the ocean may push the climate system from one quasi-stable mode of operation to another.},

	abstract = {The oceanographic features of the Ross Sea during the austral summer are described, based primarily upon observations taken aboard the U.S.N.S. Eltanin in 1968. Surface-actuated multiple samplers (SAMS) provided calibration data for electronically recorded in situ salinity-temperature-depth (STD) measurements. The eastern portion of Pennell Bank differs considerably from its outline on earlier charts. The westerly current of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) over the Ross Sea continental slope provides an dynamic barrier to northwanrd thermohaline flow of dense Ross Sea Shelf Water (RSSW). Insufficient brine may be releasd by the freezing of sea ice to produce the major portion of RSSW. Ice Shelf Water (ISW), identified by a deep temperature minimum, has temperatures as low as --- 2·13$\,^{\circ}$C near its source at the base of the Ross Ice Shelf. Low-salinity Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is formed during sumer over the continental slope in the eastern Ross Sea from a mixture of CDW and ISW. High salinity AABW is produced in summer in the western Ross Sea from a combination of RSSW and CDW. On the continental slope both AABW types are characterized by a sharp decrease in temperature and increase in oxygen near bottom. Gradient changes in continuously-recorded vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and light scattering were observed between CDW and AABW on several stations. Bottom current measurements revealed strong westerly and northerly flows down and along the continental slope, with magnitudes exceeding 15 cm/sec at eight locations.},

@article{ohshimaGlobalViewSeaice2016,
	abstract = {Global overturning circulation is driven by density differences. Saline water rejected during sea-ice formation in polynyas is the main source of dense water, and thus sea-ice production is a key factor in the overturning circulation. Due to difficulties associated with in situ observation, sea-ice production and its interannual variability have not been well understood until recently. Methods to estimate sea-ice production on large scales have been developed using heat flux calculations based on satellite microwave radiometer data. Using these methods, we present the mapping of sea-ice production with the same definition and scale globally, and review the polynya ice production and its relationship with dense/bottom water. The mapping demonstrates that ice production rate is high in Antarctic coastal polynyas, in contrast to Arctic coastal polynyas. This is consistent with the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), the densest water mass which occupies the abyssal layer of the global ocean. The Ross Ice Shelf polynya has by far the highest ice production in the Southern Hemisphere. The Cape Darnley polynya (65$\,^{\circ}$E--69$\,^{\circ}$E) is found to be the second highest production area and recent observations revealed that this is the missing (fourth) source of AABW. In the region off the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT), the third source of AABW, sea-ice production decreased by as much as 40 \%, due to the MGT calving in early 2010, resulting in a significant decrease in AABW production. The Okhotsk Northwestern polynya exhibits the highest ice production in the Northern Hemisphere, and the resultant dense water formation leads to overturning in the North Pacific, extending to the intermediate layer. Estimates of its ice production show a significant decrease over the past 30--50 years, likely causing the weakening of the North Pacific overturning. These regions demonstrate the strong linkage between variabilities of sea-ice production and bottom/intermediate water formation. The mapping has also provided surface boundary conditions and validation data of heat- and salt-flux associated with sea-ice formation/melting for various ocean and coupled models.},

UCDW is found on the middle and outer shelf along Marguerite Trough, which connects the shelf break to Marguerite Bay, and at another location farther south. UCDW intrudes in the form of frequent (four per month) and small horizontal scales (≈4 km) warm eddy-like structures with maximum vertical scales of a few hundred meters. However, no evidence of UCDW intrusions was found in Marguerite Bay. LCDW was found in several deep depressions connected to the shelf break, including Marguerite Trough, forming a tongue of relatively dense water 95 m thick (on average) that reaches into Marguerite Bay through Marguerite Trough. A steady advective-diffusive balance for the LCDW intrusion is used to make an estimation of the average upwelling rate and diffusivity in the deep layer within Marguerite Trough, which suggest the LCDW layer is renewed approximately every six weeks.},

@article{poppelmeierInfluenceElevatedNd2020,
	abstract = {The neodymium (Nd) isotopic composition of seawater is a valuable tool for the reconstruction of past water mass provenance and hence deep water geometry. A meaningful interpretation of Nd isotope down-core records requires knowledge of potential variations of water mass end member characteristics. While often assumed temporally constant, recent investigations revealed glacial-interglacial variability of the northern and southern Nd isotope end members in the Atlantic. These new constraints have a strong influence on the interpretation of the Atlantic deep water mass evolution, yet the processes responsible for the end member shifts remain uncertain. Here we combine a new compilation of Atlantic Nd isotope reconstructions of the early Holocene with the Nd-enabled Bern3D model to quantify the recently proposed hypothesis of a northern Nd isotope end member shift during the early Holocene. We achieve the best model-data fit with a strong increase of the Nd flux in the northern high latitudes by a factor of 3 to 4, which lowers the northern end member signature by about 1 ε-unit. Our findings thus agree with the rationale that glacially weathered material entered the northern Northwest Atlantic after the ice sheets retreated late in the deglaciation and released substantial amounts of unradiogenic Nd as suggested previously. Further, we find that variations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) cannot reproduce the observed Nd isotope excursions of the compiled data, ruling out an early Holocene AMOC ``overshoot.''},

	abstract = {Increased carbon sequestration in the ocean subsurface is commonly assumed to have been one of the main causes responsible for lower glacial atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Remineralized carbon must have been stored away from the atmosphere for thousands of years, yet the water mass structure accommodating such increased carbon storage continues to be debated. Here, we present new sediment-derived bottom-water neodymium isotope records that allow fingerprinting of water masses and provide a more complete picture of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation geometry during the Last Glacial Maximum. These results suggest that the vertical and meridional structure of the Atlantic water mass distribution only experienced minor changes since the last ice age. In particular, we find no compelling evidence supporting glacial southern-sourced water substantially expanding to shallower depths and farther into the Northern Hemisphere than today, which had been previously inferred from stable carbon isotope (δ13C) reconstructions. We argue that depleted δ13C values observed in the deep Northwest Atlantic do not necessarily indicate the presence of southern-sourced water. Instead, these values may represent a northern-sourced water mass with lower than modern preformed δ13C values that were further modified downstream by increased sequestration of remineralized carbon, facilitated by a more sluggish glacial deep circulation, corroborating previous evidence.},

	abstract = {The Nd isotope composition of seawater has been used to reconstruct past changes in the contribution of different water masses to the deep ocean. In the absence of contrary information, the Nd isotope compositions of endmember water masses are usually assumed constant during the Quaternary. Here we show that the Nd isotope composition of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), a major component of the global overturning ocean circulation, was significantly more radiogenic than modern during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and shifted towards modern values during the deglaciation. We propose that weathering contributions of unradiogenic Nd modulated by the North American Ice Sheet dominated the evolution of the NADW Nd isotope endmember. If water mass mixing dominated the distribution of deep glacial Atlantic Nd isotopes, our results would imply a larger fraction of NADW in the deep Atlantic during the LGM and deglaciation than reconstructed with a constant northern endmember.},

@article{piepgrasIsotopicCompositionNeodymium1988,
	abstract = {We have determined the isotopic composition of neodymium in two water column profiles in the western North Pacific and in bottom waters from three other locations in the North Pacific. The vertical profiles reveal that the water column is stratified with respect to isotopic composition. Mid-depths associated with Pacific Deep Water are uniform having ϵNd(0) ≈−3. Shallow waters are variable, but deep waters are less radiogenic having ϵMd(0) = −4.4 to −5 in the western basin. The more negative bottom waters in the western North Pacific provide evidence for the advective transport of rare earth elements from Antarctic sources to this region. Bottom waters in the eastern North Pacific are more radiogenic (ϵNd(0) = −3.3 to −3.8) indicating very little transport of REE from Antarctic sources to this basin. Overall, the isotopic composition of Nd in Pacific bottom waters appears to be conservative when compared to the silica distribution in spite of evidence for Nd removal. The findings are generally compatible with other parameters such as temperature, salinity and nutrient distributions. The presence of Nd isotopic signatures associated with Antarctic sources in these waters provides evidence for a small component of rare earth elements of North Atlantic origin in the bottom waters of the North Pacific. This is the first tracer evidence to corroborate the suggestion of Reid and Lynn (1971) that some of the temperature and salinity properties of the deep waters of the North Pacific originated in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas.},

@article{amakawaNeodymiumIsotopicVariations2004,
	abstract = {Four vertical profiles of the concentration and isotopic composition of Nd in seawater were obtained in the western North Pacific. Two profiles from the Kuroshio Current regime showed congruently that although the Nd concentration increases gradually with depth, its isotopic composition varies significantly with depth depending upon the water mass occupying the water column. The high-salinity Kuroshio waters originating from the North Pacific Tropical Water (NPTW) carry the least radiogenic Nd (ϵNd = −7.4 to −8.7) to this region at ∼250 m from the western margin continental shelves, most likely from the East China Sea. The Nd isotopic compositions in the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) that occurs at 600 to 1000 m in the subtropical region are fairly uniform at ϵNd = −3.7. The profile data from the ∼38$\,^{\circ}$ to 40$\,^{\circ}$N Kuroshio/Oyashio mixed water region off Sanriku of Honshu, Japan, also suggest that the newest NPIW with ϵNd = −3.2 is formed there by the mixing of various source waters, and the radiogenic component of Nd is derived mainly from the Oyashio waters. In the Pacific Deep Water (PDW) below ∼1000 m, the Nd isotopic composition is neither vertically nor horizontally homogeneous, suggesting that it serves as a useful tracer for sluggish deep water circulation as well. Two profiles from the Izu-Ogasawara Trench showed a minimum ϵNd value at ∼2000 m, suggesting that there exists a horizontal advective flow in the vicinity of Honshu, Japan. There is some evidence from other chemical properties to support this observation. The waters below 4000 m including those within the trench in the subtropical region have ϵNd values of around −5, suggesting that the deep waters are fed from the south along the western boundary, ultimately from the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the South Pacific. This extends up to ∼40$\,^{\circ}$N along the Japanese Islands. In the subarctic region ({\textgreater}∼42$\,^{\circ}$N), the waters have more radiogenic Nd with ϵNd {\textgreater} −4.0 throughout the water column, presumably due to the supply of Nd by weathering in such igneous provinces as the Kuril-Kamchatska-Aleutian Island chain. The lateral inhomogeneity of the Nd isotopic composition in PDW suggests that there may be different circulation and mixing regimes in the North Pacific Basin.},

@article{williamsNeodymiumIsotopeEvidence2021,
	abstract = {The chain of events surrounding the initiation and intensification of the last glacial cycle remain relatively poorly understood. In particular, the role of Southern Ocean paleocirculation changes is poorly constrained, in part, owing to a paucity of sedimentary records from this region. In this study we present multiproxy data -- including neodymium isotope and sortable silt measurements -- for paleocirculation changes within the deep (3167 m water depth) Indian sector of the Southern Ocean from a new sediment core, TT1811-34GGC (41.718$\,^{\circ}$S, 80.163$\,^{\circ}$E). We find a tight coupling between circulation changes, Antarctic climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations throughout the last 118,000 years, even during the initial stages of glacial inception of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5.4 to 5.1. We find that periods of cooling correspond to reductions in the entrainment of North Atlantic-sourced waters within the deep Southern Ocean, as evidenced by more radiogenic neodymium isotope values of deep water bathing our core site. Cooling also corresponds to generally slower bottom water flow speeds, as indicated by finer sortable silt size fractions. A reduction in entrainment of North-Atlantic sourced waters occurred during MIS 5.4--5.1, when Atlantic circulation was strong, suggesting a Southern hemisphere control on paleocirculation changes at that time. We hypothesise that expanded Southern Ocean sea-ice during MIS 5.4 increased the density of the deep Southern Ocean, reducing the ability of Atlantic-sourced waters to mix into Lower Circumpolar Deep Water. This led to an expanded contribution of Pacific Deep Water within the lower circulation cell and increased stratification within the deep Southern Ocean. These paleocirculation changes can help account for the reduction in atmospheric CO2 across the MIS 5.5 to 5.4 transition, and in doing so help explain the chain of events surrounding the decent into the last glacial period.},

@article{kakoulakiGreenHydrogenEurope2021,
	abstract = {The increasing ambition of climate targets creates a major role for hydrogen especially in achieving carbonneutrality in sectors presently difficult to decarbonise. This work examines to what extent the currently carbon-intensive hydrogen production in Europe could be replaced by water electrolysis using electricity from renewable energy resources (RES) such as solar photovoltaic, onshore/offshore wind and hydropower (green hydrogen). The study assesses the technical potential of RES at regional and national levels considering envi- ronmental constraints, land use limitations and various techno-economic parameters. It estimates localised clean hydrogen production and examines the capacity to replace carbon-intensive hydrogen hubs with ones that use RES-based water electrolysis. Findings reveal that -at national level- the available RES electricity potential ex- ceeds the total electricity demand and the part for hydrogen production from electrolysis in all analysed countries. At regional level, from the 109 regions associated with hydrogen production (EU27 and UK), 88 re- gions (81\%) show an excess of potential RES generation after covering the annual electricity demand across all sectors and hydrogen production. Notably, 84 regions have over 50\% excess RES electricity potential after covering the total electricity demand and that for water electrolysis. The study provides evidence on the option to decarbonize hydrogen production at regional level. It shows that such transformation is possible and compatible with the ongoing transition towards carbon--neutral power systems in the EU. Overall, this work aims to serve as a tool for designing hydrogen strategies in harmony with renewable energy policies.},

We have developed a model and an associated framework that can be used to determine the cost of transport methods for both land and land-and-sea scenarios. The model assesses the transportation of liquid and gaseous hydrogen by truck, rail, and barge; as well as gaseous hydrogen pipelines. Our results show that for large scale and long-distance hydrogen transport, the only feasible gaseous hydrogen transport option are pipelines. For example, a well-planned pipeline can keep hydrogen transportation costs below \$3 per kg for distances up to 7000 km so long as the demand is greater than 150 tonnes per day. Liquid hydrogen transport is feasible and efficient for long distance transport, especially when used alongside rail travel providing less than 50 tonnes per day.},

@article{barhoumiOptimalSizingPhotovoltaic2022,
	abstract = {Green hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide emission, advances the dependency on fossil fuels and improves the economy of the energy sector, especially in developing countries. Hydrogen is required for the green transportation sector and many other industrial applications. However, the high cost of green hydrogen production reduces the fast development of renewable energy projects based on hydrogen production. So, sizing by optimization is required to determine the optimum solutions for green hydrogen production. In this context, this paper aims to analyze three methods that can be developed and implemented for the production of green hydrogen for refueling stations using photovoltaic (PV) systems. Techno-economic models are adopted to calculate the Levelized Hydrogen Cost (LHC) for the PV grid-connected system, stand-alone PV system with batteries, and stand-alone PV system with fuel cells. The photovoltaic systems based green hydrogen refueling stations are optimized using Homer software. The optimization results of the Net Profit Cost (NPC), and the LHC permit the comparison of the three cases and the selection of the optimal solution. The analysis has shown that a 3 MWp grid-connected PV system represents a promising green hydrogen production at an LHC of 5.5 V/kg. The system produces 58 615 kg of green hydrogen per year reducing carbon dioxide emission by 8209 kg per year. The LHC in the stand-alone PV system with batteries, and stand-alone PV system with fuel cells are 5.74 V/kg and 7.38 V/kg, respectively.},

@article{changCurtailedElectricityHydrogen2022,
	abstract = {This study examines how well producing hydrogen via electrolysis from curtailed electricity from renewables could fulfil environmental benefits against the cost of producing hydrogen via electrolysis in the context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit (EAS). The cost of producing hydrogen via electrolysis ranges from less than USD2 per kgH2 when the electrolyser load factor is 1500 h or above to USD10 per kgH2 or even higher when the electrolyser load factor is 500 h or lower. The amount of CO2 emissions abated by hydrogen produced from curtailed electricity from renewables ranges from about 130 million tonnes to about 150 million tonnes for ASEAN and from about 18,000 million tonnes to about 19,000 million tonnes for EAS. Applying prevailing carbon prices to the CO2 emissions abated, the possible monetised benefits of hydrogen produced via electrolysis from curtailed electricity from renewables range from about USD0.25 per kgH2 to about USD9.00 per kg H2 for ASEAN and from about USD0.50 per kgH2 to about USD15.00 per kg H2 for EAS. The results of the cost-benefit analysis suggest that the price of carbon needs to be about USD15 per tonne of CO2 to justify hydrogen produced via electrolysis from curtailed electricity from renewables for both ASEAN and EAS. The results also suggest that high electrolyser load factors make hydrogen produced via electrolysis from curtailed electricity from renewables cost-competitive even under low carbon prices.},

This paper provides the first comparative analysis of solar-driven hydrogen production from environmental angles. A novel hydrogen production process proposed in this paper, named Solar-Driven Advanced Biomass Indirect-Gasification (SABI-Hydrogen), shows promise toward achieving continuous operation and scalability, the two key challenges to meet future energy needs. The calculated Global Warming Potential for 1 kg of solar-driven hydrogen production is 1.04 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, less than half of the current biomass gasification process which emits 2.67 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Further, SABI-Hydrogen demonstrates the least-carbon intensive pathway among all current hydrogen production methods. Thus, solar-driven hydrogen production from biomass could lead to a sustainable supply, essential for a low-carbon energy transition.},

To effectively utilize the excess photovoltaic power, a hybrid energy system is proposed that uses surplus electricity to produce hydrogen in this paper. It combines solar energy, hydrogen production system, and Combined Cooling Heating and Power (CCHP) system to realize cooling, heating, power, and hydrogen generation. The system supplies energy for three public buildings in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, China, and the system configuration with the lowest unit energy cost (0.0615\$/kWh) was obtained via optimization. Two comparison strategies were used to evaluate the hybrid energy system in terms of unit energy cost, annual total cost, fossil energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. Subsequently, the annual total energy supply, typical daily loads, and cost of the optimized system were analyzed. In conclusion, the system is feasible for small area public buildings, and provides a solution to solve the phenomenon of photovoltaic power curtailment.},

This assessment examines the hydrogen production and its utilization potential in one of the hydropower-rich regions, Nepal under various demand growth and technology intervention scenarios by developing a power grid model of 52 nodes and 68 transmission lines operating at an hourly time-step. The model incorporates a grid-connected hydrogen storage system as well as charging stations for electric and hydrogen vehicles. The leastcostly pathways for power grid expansion at the nodal and provincial levels are identified through optimization. The results show that 32 GW of installed capacity is required to meet domestic electricity demand and 14 GW more hydropower should be exploited to completely decarbonize the transport sector by 2050. For maintaining 50\% shares of hydrogen vehicle in the transport sector and meet government electricity export targets, Nepal requires 5.7 GW, 12 GW and 23 GW of the additional electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tanks and storage-based hydropower capacities respectively. For a given electricity demand, introducing hydrogen systems can reduce the capacity requirements of hydro storage by storing surplus power generated from pondage run-of-the-river and run-of-theriver hydropower during the rainy season and using it in the dry season.},

	abstract = {The current study develops a hydrogen map concept where renewable energy sources are considered for green hydrogen production and specifically investigates the solar energybased hydrogen production potential in Turkey. For all cities in the country, the available onshore and offshore potentials for solar energy are considered for green hydrogen production. The vacant areas are calculated after deducting the occupied areas based on the available governmental data. Abundant solar energy as a key renewable energy source is exploited by photovoltaic cells. To obtain the hydrogen generation potential, monocrystalline and polycrystalline type solar cells are considered, and the generated renewable electricity is directed to electrolysers. For this purpose, alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM), and solid oxide electrolysers (SOEs) are considered to obtain the green hydrogen. The total hydrogen production potential for Turkey is estimated to be between 415.48 and 427.22 Million tons (Mt) depending on the type of electrolyser. The results show that Erzurum, Konya, Sivas, and Van are found to be the highest hydrogen production potentials. The main idea is to prepare hydrogen map in detail for each city in Turkey, based on the solar energy potential. This, in turn, can be considered in the context of the current policies of the local communities and policy-makers to supply the required energy of each country.},

@article{ignaciomartinetNewEstimatesSalinity1997,
	abstract = {Oxygen-isotope analyses of planktonic foraminifera from 57 western Pacific deep-sea cores are compared for the Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Carbonate dissolution, sedimentation rates/bioturbation, sample density, and vital effects are assessed before the sea-surface salinity signal of these records is reconstructed. Average glacialinterglacial AS''0 values in the western Pacific are found to be close to those in the Atlantic Ocean ( 1.76\%0 in the Pacific compared to 1.80\%0 in the Atlantic), questioning previous suggestions of a larger salinity difference between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans during the LGM. During the LGM, sea-surface salinity was higher in the western Pacific than today (by {\textgreater}-1\%0), implying that evaporation minus precipitation was higher all over the region. The minimum change in sea-surface salinity occurred around the equator at the core of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. Holocene high-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations in planktonic S''O records north and south of the present limits of the Western Pacific Warm Pool are indicative of sea-surface temperature and/or sea-surface salinity variations related to its expansion and contraction at the scale of thousands of years. Such high-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations at the edge of the WPWP are best documented in the S'*O signal of ODP Hole 828A offshore Vanuatu, so far the best high-resolution record for the western Pacific.},

@article{benwayOxygenIsotopesUpperocean2004,
	abstract = {Westward transport of freshwater across the Panama Isthmus helps to maintain the salinity (S) contrast between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, important in global thermohaline circulation and climate. Relatively low sea-surface salinities in the Panama Bight reflect high net precipitation. We infer sources of this freshwater input to the region based on oxygen isotopes (d18O) of precipitation (dP) and seawater (dSW). The primary trend of the surface water dSW -- S relationship implies a freshwater endmember d18O of {\`A} 8.5 F 0.3x, significantly lower than the mean dP of rainwater we measured in the region ( {\`A} 4.8 F 1.8x), mixing with waters upwelled from the subsurface (S = 34.9 -- 35.1 PSU, dSW = 0.3 -- 0.4x). Based on limited isotope and salinity data, these upwelling waters are a mixture of f 60\% tropical waters and f 40\% subtropical mode waters. Three secondary trends in the surface water dSW -- S distribution point to similar freshwater sources with d18O of {\`A} 2.5 F 1.2x, {\`A} 4.7 F 0.5x, and {\`A} 4.8 F 0.6x, consistent with local precipitation sources. Accounting for the primary surface water trend, intermittent cross-isthmus transport of moist air masses from the Caribbean may introduce relatively 18Odepleted rainfall due to a combination of recycling and orographic distillation. In addition, relatively infrequent but large tropical storms, which may contain freshwater of both Pacific and Caribbean origin, deliver rainfall with dP of {\`A} 10x to {\`A} 14x. The primary trend of regional surface seawater data, which integrates the different sources over time, suggests that about half of the total precipitation reflects local sources, and half reflects a combination of cross-isthmus transport and large storms. The regional dSW -- S distribution is sensitive to the relative contributions of these freshwater sources, which may change under different climate regimes.},

@article{kenneyMaoriLoveStory2015,
	abstract = {Within the disaster response and research sectors, there is increasing recognition of the value of community-led initiatives that facilitate emergency management, risk reduction and community resilience. In contrast, the value of cultural approaches to disaster management and recovery is rarely acknowledged. The M{\=a}ori disaster management response to the Christchurch earthquakes and subsequent urban recovery process constitutes an exemplar of best practice. During the emergency management phase, M{\=a}ori risk management initiatives were collaborative, effective and shaped by kaupapa (cultural values), specifically the value, 'aroha nui ki te tangata' (extend love to all people). In this article, the potential value of M{\=a}ori kaupapa-based technologies for shaping contextually relevant disaster management and risk reduction strategies is considered. The discussion draws from research findings arising from two projects conducted by the Joint Centre of Disaster Research in partnership with Te R{\=u}nanga o Ng{\=a}i Tahu (resident M{\=a}ori tribe) that address M{\=a}ori disaster--related concerns, including factors that facilitate community recovery. An overview of the M{\=a}ori emergency response, including perceived hindrances, is provided as background. Drawing upon frameworks provided within Actor-Network Theory cultural technologies that facilitate community well-being and recovery are identified and the ways in which technologies were operationalised within the emergency context, outlined. With reference to the Hyogo Framework for Action the applicability of integrating M{\=a}ori technologies into national civil defence emergency management policies is also discussed and recommendations are proposed for adapting and implementing these technologies as a component of integrated disaster risk reduction at the local, national and international levels.},

The concept is often described as bouncing back or forward following disaster events. Various attempts have been made to conceptualize resilience of communities and individuals to disasters. The present research aimed to qualitatively explore survivors' perceptions of community resilience in the case of the 2011 Van earthquakes in Turkey. To this end, in-depth interviews were conducted, as part of a large-scale study, with twenty earthquake survivors recruited through snowball sampling in Van. Consensual qualitative research method was employed for data analysis. The findings provided an understanding of both specific indicators related to resilience in the post-quake period and also how survivors perceive characteristics related to general resilience for earthquakes. The findings pointed out that resilience is perceived to be related to provision of adequate, timely aid and services distributed fairly and to good governance, financial resources, and faith following earthquakes as well as to awareness, preparedness and mitigation, and social solidarity before quakes. The implications of the findings for disaster risk management with a view of facilitating resilience and suggestions for future research are provided.},

This shift has taken place just after the Kobe Earthquake in 2005, which necessitated the formulation of Hyogo Framework of Actions, the global framework for disaster risk reduction. One of the goals of this framework is to build the resilience of the communities prone to hazards and disasters. The objective of this paper is to analyze and review the frameworks on community resilience in the context of hazards and natural disasters and propose a community resilience framework for an earthquake prone area in Baluchistan, based on the findings of an extensive research carried out on vulnerability and resilience assessment. A household questionnaire survey was conducted among 200 residents of Quetta city, using random sampling method. Based on the findings, the paper has proposed a new community resilience framework, which can be used for upgrading the community preparedness, awareness, and finally leading to community resilience at the local levels.},

	abstract = {New Zealand media reports have shaped public discourses on the role of community stakeholders in responding to the devastation caused by the 2010--2011 Canterbury earthquakes and the Kaik{\=o}ura Earthquake in 2016. Anecdotal evidence has also suggested that M{\=a}ori disaster management responses to both contexts received differing levels of media attention and thus inconsistent recognition within the public domain. Iwi (M{\=a}ori tribes) have historically enacted kaitiakitanga (cultural guardianship) for their respective regions. Contemporary iwi remain obligated to ensure the wellbeing of local M{\=a}ori as well as the broader community and environment during adversity, and act accordingly. Media stories pertaining to M{\=a}ori responders' actions in the aftermath of 2016 Kaik{\=o}ura earthquakes, have highlighted the effectiveness of such community-led responses as well as the importance of maintaining a unified and well integrated approach to recovery management. In contrast, very few media reports provide comment on the M{\=a}ori earthquake recovery response to the 2010--2011 Christchurch earthquakes. In this article, the ways in which M{\=a}ori responses were represented by the media following both natural hazard events, are examined. Media conceptualisations of M{\=a}ori disaster management leadership are explored through drawing on content and thematic analyses while constructions of M{\=a}ori cultural identity are considered in the context of disaster management practices. Tensions pertaining to public recognition and legitimatisation of M{\=a}ori response capabilities are also documented and will inform refinement of media approaches to disaster communication as well as national emergency management policy and protocols.},

Based on empirical evidence from longitudinal qualitative research we explore the resilience capacities and resources deployed in five low-income communities within Talcahuano, one of the cities most heavily affected by the power outage. Our research reveals that community resilience attenuates the negative consequences of power outages during the response and recovery periods. However, external assistance is required to reduce the short and long-term societal impact of prolonged outages. Policy recommendations and guidelines are provided on how to increase community resilience and reduce the negative impact of long-lasting power outages.},

@article{pandayRoleSocialCapital2021,
	abstract = {Social capital is widely regarded as a key element in recovery from and resilience to disasters. Yet, little attention has been paid to the specificities of what supports or undermines remote rural communities' social capital in disasters. Here, we examine how bonding, bridging, and linking social capital operated after the 2015 earthquake in three remote Nepali communities of Sindhupalchok and Gorkha Districts, which have varying degrees of access to infrastructure, relief and recovery programmes. We draw on community-based qualitative research conducted in 2018 (including data from Participatory Videos, Focus Group Discussions and Key Informant In- terviews) to show how different forms of social capital `matter' more in different phases of recovery. Immediately after the earthquake, high levels of bonding and bridging social capital among residents reduced barriers to collective action and helped efforts to rescue and support affected individuals. This dissipated, however, once external relief arrived. Already-marginalised groups with low social capital of all types were less able to access relief items and funding for rebuilding compared with those of higher social status or with political links. Preexisting socio-cultural inequalities, including those driven by weak bonding relationships in families, gender inequalities and the remoteness of villages, further undermined communities' social capital and their resilience to the earthquake. Disaster relief programmes should target women and the elderly to improve the resilience of marginalised communities to future disasters. For long-term resilience, disaster programmes should consider social capital in terms of power and pre-existing inequalities, so that linking capital would not just serve elite groups.},

	abstract = {Livelihood plays an indispensable role in sustainable community development. Previous studies of sustainable livelihood have focused on the factors that contribute to the vulnerability or resilience of livelihood, but there is limited understanding of the factors that determine people's livelihood restoration after a major disaster. By using a mixed method, combined interviews with questionnaires, this research has quantified the critical factors that influence the livelihood recovery of local communities affected by the Lushan earthquake in 2013, China. The statistical analysis shows that the most highly ranked top four factors are access to income generation assets, external housing recovery support, the level of community participation in decision making, and availability of family support. Factor analysis further suggested that the 16 critical factors identified fall into four categories, namely: 1) government policies; 2) access to resources; 3) social cohesion; 4) individual characteristics. For livelihood recovery to be embedded in the longterm sustainable development of earthquake-affected communities in Lushan, it is important to address the sustainable development through a proper knowledge transfer process including training, education, and more novel community services.},

@article{macabuagSeismicRetrofittingNonengineered2012,
	abstract = {One of the greatest causes of casualties in major earthquakes around the world is the collapse of non-engineered masonry buildings (those built without engineering input). Yet by definition non-engineered structures remain largely outside of the scope of modern engineering research, meaning that the majority of those at risk often remain so. A further barrier to realising research in this field is the significant social and economic challenge of implementation in low-income communities, where non-engineered housing is prevalent. This paper introduces a retrofitting technique aimed at preventing or prolonging the collapse of adobe (mud brick) houses under strong earthquakes. This technique uses common polypropylene packaging straps to form a mesh, which is then used to encase structural walls. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the retrofitting technique's development and implementation. The key development stages of static, dynamic and numerical testing are presented, showing that the proposed technique effectively prevents brittle masonry collapse and the loss of debris. An implementation project is then discussed, involving a training programme for rural masons in Nepal, a public shake-table demonstration and the retrofit of a real house. The implementation project proved effective at reaching rural communities but highlighted that government subsidies are required to incentivise the safeguarding of homes among low-income communities.},

One particular response has been the development of community-based training programmes designed to teach residents basic emergency response skills. Citizens are taught emergency medical techniques, search and rescue, fire suppression and other fundamental response skills. Current estimates in the Bay Area place the number of programmes at more than 100. Many programmes now include an annual community drill to reinforce the training and to evaluate the programme. The study described here is based on an evaluation of an effort initiated by BayNET (Bay Area Neighborhood Emergency Training), a voluntary association of communities with community-based disaster preparedness programmes. In April 1996, BayNET asked all of its members to hold a community earthquake drill. After the drill, a mail survey was conducted of all programme managers. The survey examined the structure and administration of the programmes, training efforts and other related components. This paper describes the typology of drill formats that communities used, the role of the simulation in the city's preparedness efforts, the qualitative costs and benefits, as well as an assessment of the drill based on survey respondents.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based participatory intervention on earthquake preparedness in Tehran.
Methods: This community-engaged research was conducted during 2011 to 2013. An intervention and a control neighborhood were chosen through systematic cluster sampling. In the intervention group 305 households and in the control group 314 households were sampled for pre- and post-assessment surveys. A participatory intervention was designed on the basis of consultation with the community advisory board and was implemented by trained volunteers. Changes in outcome variables in the intervention and control groups were detected in terms of knowledge, attitude, and practice. Pearson chi-square tests and covariance regression were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.
Results: The results showed that the frequency of earthquake experience in the intervention and control groups was 69.2\% and 79.0\%, respectively. Moreover, the mean difference scores in knowledge, attitude, and practice in the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention were significant (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: A participatory intervention effectively improved disaster preparedness at a community level. To ensure sustainability, the participatory approach should be integrated into public health disaster planning. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:211-218)},

	abstract = {Natural or human-made hazards may occur at any time. Although one might assume that individuals plan in advance for such potentially damaging events, the existing literature indicates that most communities remain inadequately prepared. In the past, research in this area has focused on identifying the most effective ways to communicate risk and elicit preparedness by means of public hazard education campaigns and risk communication programmes. Today, web- and mobile-based technologies are offering new and far-reaching means to inform communities on how to prepare for or cope with extreme events, thus significantly contributing to community preparedness. Nonetheless, their practical efficacy in encouraging proactive hazard preparedness behaviours is not yet proven. Building on behaviour change interventions in the health field and looking in particular at earthquakes and fire hazards, the challenging RISK team has reviewed the currently active websites, Web, and mobile applications that provide information about earthquake and home fire preparedness. The review investigates the type of information provided, the modality of delivery, and the presence of behaviour change techniques in their design. The study proves that most of the digital resources focus on a single hazard and fail to provide context-sensitive information that targets specific groups of users. Furthermore, behaviour change techniques are rarely implemented in the design of these applications and their efficacy is rarely systematically evaluated.

@article{cobanWhichTrainingMethod2022,
	abstract = {One of the most important reasons for deaths and injuries caused by earthquakes is that society does not have sufficient knowledge of appropriate protective behaviors during an earthquake. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different educational practices in providing primary school students with the knowledge of earthquake preparedness and protection from potential hazards of an earthquake. Considering the quasi-experimental research, the pretest--posttest control/comparison group design was used, and a total of 401 students from the fourth grade in four different schools constituted the sampling of the study. Within the study, three types of educational activities were applied: digital games evaluating smart learning environments, earthquake drills, and traditional education. Findings show that the most effective way to teach students what to do during an earthquake is the earthquake drill. This study also indicates that the design elements in the three-dimensional earthquake game developed in the scope of the research played an effective role in earthquake education. This study is of importance as it provides significant results on how to determine the most appropriate educational method for primary school students and how digital games can be used more effectively in the learning process.},

@article{beckerRolePriorExperience2017,
	abstract = {Motivating household preparedness for earthquakes can be difficult, especially given the infrequent and varying nature of major events. Past research has shown that people's experiences contribute to their beliefs about whether, and how, they should prepare for earthquakes. Direct experience of a disaster can be a strong motivator of preparedness; however, most people will not directly experience a large damaging earthquake in their lifetimes. They instead need to rely on experience of small earthquakes, experience of different disasters, adverse life experiences (e.g. accidents), or vicarious experience. This paper explores the influence of such experiences on earthquake preparedness. The research found that experience has seven different influences on the preparedness process including: prompting thinking and talking; raising awareness and knowledge; helping individuals understand the consequences of a disaster; developing beliefs; developing preparedness; influencing emotions and feelings; and prompting community interaction on disaster issues.},

@article{shawLinkingExperienceEducation2004,
	abstract = {To understand the impact of earthquake experience and education on awareness, a survey was conducted with 1,065 high school first grade students from five prefectures of Japan. Results showed that earthquake experience is not the prime factor to enhance awareness. Education, when it is confined to school education, can provide useful information as the knowledge base for earthquake. However, in the gradual path of knowing, realizing, deepening, decision and action, family, community, and self education are found to be more prominent. While, self education is important for realizing and deepening, family and community education play the most vital role for decision and actions. In school education, more active ways of disaster education through conversation, experiencing, and visual aids are found to be more effective. It is believed that school education, coupled with self, family and community education can help a student to develop a ``culture of disaster preparedness'', which, in turn, will urge them to take right decisions and actions as an adult.},

@article{bossuImportanceSmartphonesPublic2015,
	abstract = {This study investigates how people affected by the 2015 Ghorka earthquake sequence in Nepal have adopted and used the LastQuake smartphone application and associated Twitter robot, which offer rapid earthquake information focusing on felt and damaging earthquakes. It is shown that mobile devices played a key role in Nepal by providing access to earthquake information and that the LastQuake smartphone application was rapidly identified and adopted through viral spread after the mainshock. Thumbnail-based questionnaires, which have replaced online macroseismic questionnaires on the smartphone application and on the website for mobile devices, ease language barriers and have proven to be very efficient for collecting testimonies within a few tens of minutes of a felt-earthquake occurrence.Offering rapid information on felt and damaging earthquakes is an effective strategy to engage with eyewitnesses and optimize the collection of eyewitnesses' observations. The two-way and real-time communication channels that smartphones offer raises eyewitnesses' expectations in terms of real-time information but also offer an opportunity to improve situation awareness and provide rapid and direct guidance to individuals immediately after shaking to contribute to risk reduction.},

It is distinguished from earthquake prediction in that the earthquake has nucleated to provide detectable ground motion when an EEW is issued. Here we review progress in the field in the last 10 years. We begin with EEW users, synthesizing what we now know about who uses EEW and what information they need and can digest. We summarize the approaches to EEW and gather information about currently existing EEW systems implemented in various countries while providing the context and stimulus for their creation and development. We survey important advances in methods, instrumentation, and algorithms that improve the quality and timeliness of EEW alerts. We also discuss the development of new, potentially transformative ideas and methodologies that could change how we provide alerts in the future. ▪ Earthquake early warning (EEW) is the rapid detection and characterization of earthquakes and delivery of an alert so that protective actions can be taken. ▪ EEW systems now provide public alerts in Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan and alerts to select user groups in India, Turkey, Romania, and the United States. ▪ EEW methodologies fall into three categories, point source, finite fault, and ground motion models, and we review the advantages of each of these approaches. ▪ The wealth of information about EEW uses and user needs must be employed to focus future developments and improvements in EEW systems.},

	abstract = {A field investigation of the 26 December 2004 south east Asia earthquake- and tsunami-affected areas in Thailand and Indonesia was conducted. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of the event on buildings, bridges and infrastructure. The effect of the tsunami on structures and infrastructure produced surprising behaviour with several new lessons to learn. Failure of critical infrastructure such as bridges, harbour docks, hospitals and communication systems delayed search and rescue operations and relief efforts, which increased the suffering of the survivors. The causes of structural failures due to the earthquake included soft story, strong beam--weak column designs, short columns, deficient beam--column joints, non-ductile detailing, unreinforced masonry and inadequate construction quality. It is concluded that it is necessary to design critical structures and important infrastructure to survive tsunami effects. Well-designed and constructed structures with attention to details and no significant additional cost survived the earthquake and the resulting tsunami with minimum damage.},

@article{himotoComparativeAnalysisPostEarthquake2019,
	abstract = {Post-earthquakes fires are high-consequence events, which may cause extensive damage once occurred. However, their nature has not been fully investigated as they are low-frequency events at the same time. A questionnaire survey was conducted for the fire services that corresponded to post-earthquake fires in their areas of jurisdiction in recent years, and outline data on fires following nine earthquakes was collected. A database containing information on 665 fires following 11 earthquakes in Japan from 1995 to 2017 was constructed by integrating survey data into an existing database of fires following the 1995 Kobe and 2011 Tohoku earthquakes. Through this database, the features of post-earthquake fires were comparatively analyzed from the viewpoint of types and causes of fire, ignition, fire spread in urban areas, firefighting activity, fatalities, and damage to fire safety equipment systems. The result shows that electrical is increasing in proportion in comparison with the earlier earthquakes among several causes of ignition; about 70\% of all ignitions following major earthquakes occurred within a day from the shaking; and the average time required for fire engines to discharge water after ignition increased by 8--25 times in comparison with the ordinary cases. Quantitative correlations for the rate of ignition, \$\$ r \$\$, cumulative relative frequency of ignition, \$\$ f \$\$, and virtual travel speed of fire engines, \$\$ v\_\{FF\} \$\$, that can be used for the risk assessment of post-earthquake fires were also developed. This comparative analysis provides a comprehensive perspective on the issues of post-earthquake fires that have formerly been analyzed fragmentally and construct a technical basis for the future studies.},

@article{badawiObservations12October1994,
	abstract = {An earthquake of local magnitude 5.3 (duration magnitudeMd) on the Richter Scale occurred at Dahshour, 18 km south of Cairo, Egypt, on Monday, 12 October 1992 at 3:09 pm (local time). Numerous aftershocks followed the main event during the following weeks with magnitude up to 4.3. The earthquake occurred in an area that has had no recent seismic activity, and affected many cities in Egypt. Many buildings and monuments were severely damaged or collapsed. Modern concrete skeletal structures suffered minor nonstructural damage. Earthquake physical damage was estimated at about one billion U.S. Dollars. The severity of the damage was mainly due to poor construction materials and detailing, aging, inferior workmanship, and inadequate maintenance. Egypt was generally considered to be an area of moderate seismic activity. In 1989, earthquake provisions were first introduced in the Egyptian Code of Practice for Reinforced Concrete Structures only. The earthquake clearly showed the urgent need for an assessment and rehabilitation program to mitigate seismic risk hazard in existing structures. In addition, future development planning, and earthquake preparedness strategies should implement lessons learned from the event. In this paper, an overview discussion about the observations from the 12 October earthquake is presented.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of tsunami drills in guiding evacuation behavior remains uninvestigated. Accumulation of evidence regarding the effectiveness of tsunami drills would be beneficial for improving survival and health of communities to be inundated by a tsunami. A questionnaire to inquire participants' location at the onset of the Great East Japan Earthquake and experience of the tsunami was issued as part of a survey of total adult residents of Shichigahama town whose houses were significantly damaged by the disaster. Along with the location information, self-reported information on participation in tsunami disaster drills and attendance of a lecture about tsunamis before the disaster and whether the participants evacuated after the earthquake was subjected to multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounding factors. Amongst the 2314 participants who were present in the town at the onset of the disaster and completed the questionnaires, 1560 (67\%) evacuated after the earthquake. The rate of evacuation was significantly higher amongst the population who participated in tsunami disaster drills before the event than amongst those who did not participate (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio [MOR] = 1.99, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53--2.61, p {\textless} 0.01). However, other experience of earthquake and tsunami disaster prevention before the event did not affect evacuation behavior (MOR = 0.86--1.16). A survey of the population who survived the catastrophe provides initial evidence to advocate the administration of tsunami drills in seaside communities to enhance the evacuation behavior immediately after the disaster onset.},

	abstract = {Earthquakesare one of the most significant natural hazards in Nepal and there is a long history of destructive earthquakes in the region. Despite the risk of earthquake disasters, however, school construction practice in Nepal has largely ignored the issues of structural safety. Most schools are built without following proper design guidelines. As an effective tool to reduce earthquake disaster risk in the public schools of Nepal, the Public School Earthquake Safety Program was recently initiated in Nepal. In this program, more than 1000 public schools from six districts of Nepal were evaluated for earthquake safety, and various awareness raising and retrofitting programs were implemented. This paper describes the program features, extent of community participation, retrofitting processes and lessons learned while implementing the earthquake safety program. It also demonstrates how school earthquake safety programs ultimately increase the seismic safety of the entire community in the Himalayan regions.},

	abstract = {Natural hazards are natural processes of the complex Earth system and may interact and affect each other. Often a single hazard can trigger a subsequent, different hazard, such as earthquakes triggering landslides. The effect of such cascading hazards has received relatively little attention in the literature. The majority of previous research has focused on single hazards in isolation, and even multi-hazard risk assessment currently does not account for the interaction between hazards, therefore ignoring potential amplification effects. Global earthquake-and-landslide fatality data were used to model cascading events to explore relationships between the number of fatalities during single and cascading events and covariates. A multivariate statistical approach was used to model the relationship between earthquake fatalities and several covariates. The covariates included earthquake magnitude, gross domestic product, slope, poverty, health, access to cities, exposed population to earthquake shaking, building strength and whether a landslide was triggered or not. Multivariate regression analysis showed the numbers of earthquake fatalities are significantly affected by whether a subsequent landslide is triggered or not.},

The Israeli Home Front Command conducts a yearly earthquake education programme in all Israeli schools, using three types of educational interventions: lectures, drills and a combination of the two. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in providing students with knowledge. We distributed a questionnaire to 2,648 children from the 5th and 6th grades in 120 schools nationwide. Knowledge scores for both 5th and 6th grades were increased, regardless of type of intervention, compared to the non-exposure group. A combined intervention of lectures and drills resulted in the highest knowledge scores. Our findings suggest that for the age group studied a combination of lectures and drills will likely prepare students best for how to behave in the event of an earthquake.},

@article{jahangiriComparativeStudyCommunity2011,
	abstract = {Purpose Iran is located among the top disaster‐prone countries in the world and, therefore, disaster management is considered to be one of the most important issues in this country. One of the existing and worldwide approaches for managing disasters is the so‐called community‐based disaster management (CBDM). Community participation means that people's contribution in the disaster management cycle can be started from the basic steps of a process and ends in the achievement and institutionalization in the community. The purpose of this paper is to make a comparative study on the CBDM in various selected countries in order to design a model for Iran. Design/methodology/approach A descriptive‐comparative study was undertaken through a methodology including six steps in which a few countries have been chosen based on their contribution to issues such as policy making, planning, coordination, and control and organizing of disasters as well as their experience in disaster management and access to related information. Findings The results of the study show that, in order to achieve a successful disaster management, there is a need for the participation of the community in various disaster management lifecycles. However, it is evident that the type of contribution may differ according to the characteristics of each specific country. Practical implications By using the CDBM, it is hoped that, with updating and implementing this model, the government's capability enhances in order to encounter disasters more effectively in the future. Originality/value On the basis of these findings, a model was designed to use CDBM in Iran. The issue most emphasized by this model is the presence and contribution of community at the local level in villages and neighborhoods in a city.},

@article{fengHarnessingInformalEducation2017,
	abstract = {Purpose Disaster education is considered as a newly emerging area of research and practice, which promotes community-based educational approaches for building resilience. Given the atypical nature of these disturbances, people and communities need to develop the knowledge required to anticipate and understand what they could have to contend with and proactively develop strategies that can minimize their risk and afford ways to cope with and adapt to adverse situations in an effective manner. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that informal education resulting from daily activities related to work, family life, or leisure can be harnessed to develop disaster resilience within community settings. Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper provides the discussion and synthesis of literature covering community resilience, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and informal education. In doing so, this study proposes a conceptual framework and implementation strategies for harnessing informal education in building community resilience. Findings To harness informal disaster education for community resilience, the authors suggest a conceptual framework and four implementation strategies with the corresponding implications: cultivate social environment for conversations, discussions, reflections and learning; design social activities for promoting and encouraging informal learning; appropriate interventions by informal educators in social activities; and transparent resources and channels for information and social supports. A compilation of a number of community-based DRR practices involving civil society organizations has been incorporated in the proposed framework for exemplifying informal disaster education for community resilience. Originality/value Promoting informal education in community settings is aimed at building community resilience in a collective way, which is especially important in disaster-prone areas. Informal education for community resilience not only educates individuals how to deal with disasters, but also connects individuals together to be more resilient in their ability to cope or bounce back from adverse events in their life.},

	abstract = {The Nordic Seas are the primary location where the warm waters of the North Atlantic Current densify to form North Atlantic Deep Water, which plays a key part in the modern Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The formation of dense water in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean and resulting ocean circulation changes were probably driven by and contributed to the regional and global climate of the last glacial maximum (LGM). Here we map the source and degree of mixing of deep water in the Nordic Seas and through the Arctic Gateway (Yermak Plateau) over the past 35 thousand years using neodymium isotopes (εNd) measured on authigenic phases in deep-sea sediments with a high spatial and temporal resolution. We find that a large-scale reorganization of deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas took place between the LGM (23--18 thousand years ago) and the rapid climate shift that accompanied the subsequent deglaciation (18--10 thousand years ago). We show that homogeneous εNd signatures across a wide range of sites support LGM deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas. In contrast, during the deglaciation, disparate and spatially variable εNd values are observed leading to the conclusion that deep-water formation may have been reduced during this time.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 982 provided a key sediment section at Rockall Plateau for reconstructing northeast Atlantic paleoceanography and monitoring benthic δ18O stratigraphy over the late Pliocene to Quaternary onset of major Northern Hemisphere glaciation. A renewed hole-specific inspection of magnetostratigraphic reversals and the addition of epibenthic δ18O records for short Pliocene sections in holes 982A, B, and C, crossing core breaks in the δ18O record published for Hole 982B, now imply a major revision of composite core depths. After tuning to the orbitally tuned reference record LR04, the new composite δ18O record results in a hiatus, where the Kaena magnetic subchron might have been lost, and in a significant age reduction for all proxy records by 130 to 20 ky over the time span 3.2--2.7 million years ago (Ma). Our study demonstrates the general significance of reliable composite-depth scales and δ18O stratigraphies in ODP sediment records for generating ocean-wide correlations in paleoceanography. The new concept of age control makes the late Pliocene trends in SST (sea surface temperature) and atmospheric pCO2 at Site 982 more consistent with various paleoclimate trends published from elsewhere in the North Atlantic.},

          , 
            The formation of the Isthmus of Panama stands as one of the greatest natural events of the Cenozoic, driving profound biotic transformations on land and in the oceans. Some recent studies suggest that the Isthmus formed many millions of years earlier than the widely recognized age of approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), a result that if true would revolutionize our understanding of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary change across the Americas. To bring clarity to the question of when the Isthmus of Panama formed, we provide an exhaustive review and reanalysis of geological, paleontological, and molecular records. These independent lines of evidence converge upon a cohesive narrative of gradually emerging land and constricting seaways, with formation of the Isthmus of Panama sensu stricto around 2.8 Ma. The evidence used to support an older isthmus is inconclusive, and we caution against the uncritical acceptance of an isthmus before the Pliocene.},

	abstract = {The first opening of the Bering Strait was an important palaeogeographical and biogeographical event for marine and terrestrial biotas in Asia and North America1,2,3, and an oceanographic event of global importance4,5,6. This event, however, has never been precisely dated, so it has not been accurately incorporated into models of global biogeography and oceanography. A recent find of the bivalve mollusc Astarte in southern Alaska is a clear signal that the strait had opened by at least the Late Miocene or earliest Pliocene epochs, because this genus otherwise dwelled only in the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans at that time1,2. Here we show that marine diatoms with Astarte are correlative with subzone b of the Neodenticula kamtschatica zone of the North Pacific diatom biochronology, yielding an age range of 4.8--5.5 Myr (refs 7, 8). Stratigraphic information suggests that this may be a minimum age range for the strait's first opening, which evidently occurred between 4.8 and 7.3--7.4 Myr ago. Our results contrast with past studies9,10,11,12,13 that suggested an age of 3.1--4.1 Myr for the initial opening of the Bering Strait.},

	abstract = {DEEP water in the world's oceans flows predominantly from the northern North Atlantic into the Pacific1, slowly upwells on the way to become part of the upper warm-water circulation, and returns to the North Atlantic. The stability of this thermohaline conveyor belt has recently been questioned on the basis of palaeoclimatic data from deep-sea sediment and ice cores2,3. Different modes of deep circulation have been confirmed in numeri-cal ocean models4--6, and the present-day circulation has been shown to be sensitive to changes in the surface-water budget7. Here we use an idealized model4,5 to examine the hypothesis that small changes in the atmospheric flux of fresh water from the Atlantic to the Pacific could force the thermohaline circulation to switch between two stable modes. Our results indicate that a decrease of this flux can reverse the Atlantic circulation, although the Pacific thermohaline circulation does not change direction. This is consistent with reconstructions of conditions in the Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial obtained from deep-sea cores8. To reestablish the conveyor belt, the fresh-water flux need be increased only slightly beyond its present value.},

@article{richterMoistureTransportAtlantic2010,
	abstract = {Atmospheric moisture transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin plays an important role in regulating North Atlantic salinity and thus the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Potential changes in the strength of this moisture transport are investigated for two different climate-change scenarios: North Atlantic cooling representative of Heinrich events, and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. The effect of North Atlantic cooling is studied using a coupled regional model with comparatively high resolution that successfully simulates Central American gap winds and other important aspects of the region. Cooler North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) in this model leads to a regional decrease of atmospheric moisture but also to an increase in wind speed across Central America via an anomalous pressure gradient. The latter effect dominates, resulting in a 0.13 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) increase in overall moisture transport to the Pacific basin. In fresh water forcing simulations with four different general circulation models, the wind speed effect is also present but not strong enough to completely offset the effect of moisture decrease except in one model. The influence of GHG forcing is studied using simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archive. In these simulations atmospheric moisture increases globally, resulting in an increase of moisture transport by 0.25 Sv from the Atlantic to Pacific. Thus, in both scenarios, moisture transport changes act to stabilize the thermohaline circulation. The notion that the Andes effectively block moisture transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin is not supported by the simulations and atmospheric reanalyses examined here. This indicates that such a blocking effect does not exist or else that higher resolution is needed to adequately represent the steep orography of the Andes.},

The key feature of our dataset is a long-term trend towards radiogenic εNd values of {\textasciitilde}−4.6 during the Last Glacial Maximum and Heinrich Stadial 1, which are clearly distinct from contemporaneous Southern Ocean εNd of {\textasciitilde}−7. When combined with previously published radiocarbon data from the same corals, our results indicate that a unique radiogenic and young water mass was present during this time. This scenario can be explained by a more vigorous Pacific overturning circulation that supported a deeper outflow of Pacific waters, including North Pacific Intermediate Water, through the Tasman Sea.},

Here, we present global core-top calibrations of the ``size-normalized weight'' (SNW) of planktonic foraminifera for estimating paleo-deep-water Δ[CO32−]. Then, we apply this approach to reconstruct deep-water Δ[CO32−] in the western tropical Pacific since ∼1.4 Ma. At ∼1.0--0.9 Ma, a rapid weakening of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) resulted in a transient increase of ∼10 μmol kg−1 in deep-water Δ[CO32−], after which deep-water Δ[CO32−] declined at ∼0.9--0.7 Ma. Glacial and interglacial deep-water Δ[CO32−] reveals stepwise declines of about 7 and 10 μmol kg−1, respectively, after MIS 20 (0.79--0.81 Ma) and MIS 19 (0.76--0.79 Ma), reflecting increased DIC content in the deep Pacific. We infer that a sustained increase in deep Pacific carbon storage following the MPT was linked to enhanced oceanic stratification and greater influence of CO2-rich Southern Ocean-sourced waters.},

@article{burlsSimulatingPlioceneWarmth2014,
	abstract = {Available evidence suggests that during the early Pliocene (4--5 Ma) the mean east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial Pacific Ocean was significantly smaller than today, possibly reaching only 1--2◦C. The meridional SST gradients were also substantially weaker, implying an expanded ocean warm pool in low latitudes. Subsequent global cooling led to the establishment of the stronger, modern temperature gradients. Given our understanding of the physical processes that maintain the present-day cold tongue in the east, warm pool in the west and hence sharp temperature contrasts, determining the key factors that maintained early Pliocene climate still presents a challenge for climate theories and models. This study demonstrates how different cloud properties could provide a solution. We show that a reduction in the meridional gradient in cloud albedo can sustain reduced meridional and zonal SST gradients, an expanded warm pool and warmer thermal stratification in the ocean, and weaker Hadley and Walker circulations in the atmosphere. Having conducted a range of hypothetical modified cloud albedo experiments, we arrive at our Pliocene simulation, which shows good agreement with proxy SST data from major equatorial and coastal upwelling regions, the tropical warm pool, middle and high latitudes, and available subsurface temperature data. As suggested by the observations, the simulated Pliocene-like climate sustains a robust El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation despite the reduced mean east-west SST gradient. Our results demonstrate that cloud albedo changes may be a critical element of Pliocene climate and that simulating the meridional SST gradient correctly is central to replicating the geographical patterns of Pliocene warmth.},

	abstract = {A new assessment of how much heat Earth has accumulated since 1960 is made by examining ocean heat content changes.
          , 
            Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) drives the ongoing global warming and can best be assessed across the historical record (that is, since 1960) from ocean heat content (OHC) changes. An accurate assessment of OHC is a challenge, mainly because of insufficient and irregular data coverage. We provide updated OHC estimates with the goal of minimizing associated sampling error. We performed a subsample test, in which subsets of data during the data-rich Argo era are colocated with locations of earlier ocean observations, to quantify this error. Our results provide a new OHC estimate with an unbiased mean sampling error and with variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales (signal) that can be reliably distinguished from sampling error (noise) with signal-to-noise ratios higher than 3. The inferred integrated EEI is greater than that reported in previous assessments and is consistent with a reconstruction of the radiative imbalance at the top of atmosphere starting in 1985. We found that changes in OHC are relatively small before about 1980; since then, OHC has increased fairly steadily and, since 1990, has increasingly involved deeper layers of the ocean. In addition, OHC changes in six major oceans are reliable on decadal time scales. All ocean basins examined have experienced significant warming since 1998, with the greatest warming in the southern oceans, the tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean, and the tropical/subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This new look at OHC and EEI changes over time provides greater confidence than previously possible, and the data sets produced are a valuable resource for further study.},

	abstract = {The closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS) resulted in changes of ocean-climate dynamics since the late Miocene following the uplift of northern Andes. Reconstructing the bottom-water temperatures (BWTs) of the Caribbean Sea illustrates feedbacks of the closure on the ocean-climate system including deep-water dynamics of the Caribbean Sea. Here, Mg/Ca-derived BWTs of the Plio-Pleistocene Caribbean Sea from the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi are presented for the first time and interpreted along with Na/Ca and Sr/Ca as proxies of salinity and continental input, respectively. Our results highlight several warm (93, Gi15-19, and N1) and cool (92, M2, Gi20, and CN4) marine isotope stages (MISs). Accordingly, changes in the circulation of deep-water masses during the CAS closure developed in four main time intervals: (I) between 5.2 and 4.1 Ma (million years ago) BWT was 1.1$\,^{\circ}$C, (II) 4.1--3.2 Ma 2.1$\,^{\circ}$C, (III) 3.2--2.7 Ma 2.7$\,^{\circ}$C, and (IV) 2.7--2.2 Ma 2.1$\,^{\circ}$C. Relatively higher, gradually increased temperatures between 3.2 and 2.7 Ma correspond to late Pliocene warmth and restricted inflow of Pacific waters into the Caribbean due to shoaling of the CAS. In addition, Sr/Ca values reveal gradually escalating terrigenous input until 2.7 Ma most likely related to the increased river discharge in response to the Andean uplift. The gradual decrease of the BWTs from 2.7 Ma may have resulted from the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Overall, BWTs match with previous sea surface temperatures from the planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. The BWTs presented here confirm intensified thermohaline circulation during the overall Pliocene warmth with increased bottom-water Na/Ca values indicating enhanced salinity.},

We use benthic foraminiferal B/Ca ratios to reconstruct relative changes in [CO32−] from the South Atlantic, East Pacific and Southern Oceans. Our results suggest an increase of perhaps {\textasciitilde}40 μmol/kg may have occurred between {\textasciitilde}15 and 14 Ma in intermediate to deep waters in each basin. This long-term increase suggests elevated alkalinity input, perhaps from the Himalaya, rather than other shorter-term mechanisms such as ocean circulation or ecological changes and may account for some of the proposed atmospheric CO2 decline before {\textasciitilde}14 Ma.},

The nature of the early glaciation history of the Northern Hemisphere is much debated, however. A paper in this issue reports stratigraphically extensive ice-rafted debris in late Eocene to early Oligocene sediments from the Norwegian--Greenland Sea, deposited between 38 and 30 million years ago.

@article{baileyAlternativeSuggestionPliocene2013,
	abstract = {The onset of abundant ice-rafted debris (IRD) deposition in the Nordic Seas and subpolar North Atlantic Ocean 2.72 millions of years ago (Ma) is thought to record the Pliocene onset of major northern hemisphere glaciation (NHG) due to a synchronous advance of North American Laurentide, Scandinavian and Greenland ice-sheets to their marine calving margins during marine isotope stage (MIS) G6. Numerous marine and terrestrial records from the Nordic Seas region indicate that extensive ice sheets on Greenland and Scandinavia increased IRD inputs to these seas from 2.72 Ma. The timing of ice-sheet expansion on North America as tracked by IRD deposition in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, however, is less clear because both Europe and North America are potential sources for icebergs in this region. Moreover, cosmogenic-dating of terrestrial tills on North America indicate that the Laurentide Ice Sheet did not extend to ∼39$\,^{\circ}$N until 2.4 $\pm$ 0.14 Ma, at least 180 ka after the onset of major IRD deposition at 2.72 Ma. To address this problem, we present the first detailed analysis of the geochemical provenance of individual sand-sized IRD deposited in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean between MIS G6 and 100 (∼2.72--2.52 Ma). IRD provenance is assessed using laser ablation lead (Pb) isotope analyses of single ice-rafted ({\textgreater}150 μm) feldspar grains. To track when an ice-rafting setting consistent with major NHG first occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Pliocene intensification of NHG (iNHG), we investigate when the Pb-isotope composition (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) of feldspars deposited at DSDP Site 611 first resembles that determined for IRD deposited at this site during MIS 100 (2.52 Ma), the oldest glacial for which there exists convincing evidence for widespread glaciation of North America. Whilst Quaternary-magnitude IRD fluxes exist at Site 611 during glacials from 2.72 Ma, we find that the provenance of this IRD is not constant. Instead, we find that the Pb-isotope composition of IRD at our study site is not consistent with major NHG until MIS G2 (2.64 Ma). We hypothesise that IRD deposition in the North Atlantic Ocean prior to MIS G2 was dominated by iceberg calving from Greenland and Scandinavia. We further suggest that the grounding line of continental ice on Northeast America may not have extended onto the continental shelf and calved significant numbers of icebergs to the North Atlantic Ocean during glacials until 2.64 Ma.},

	abstract = {Late Pleistocene sea level has been reconstructed from ocean sediment core data using a wide variety of proxies and models. However, the accuracy of individual reconstructions is limited by measurement error, local variations in salinity and temperature, and assumptions particular to each technique. Here we present a sea level stack (average) which increases the signal-to-noise ratio of individual reconstructions. Specifically, we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on seven records from 0 to 430 ka and five records from 0 to 798 ka. The first principal component, which we use as the stack, describes ∼ 80 \% of the variance in the data and is similar using either five or seven records. After scaling the stack based on Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea level estimates, the stack agrees to within 5 m with isostatically adjusted coral sea level estimates for Marine Isotope Stages 5e and 11 (125 and 400 ka, respectively). Bootstrapping and random sampling yield mean uncertainty estimates of 9--12 m (1σ ) for the scaled stack. Sea level change accounts for about 45 \% of the total orbitalband variance in benthic δ18O, compared to a 65 \% contribution during the LGM-to-Holocene transition. Additionally, the second and third principal components of our analyses reflect differences between proxy records associated with spatial variations in the δ18O of seawater.},

Estimates of eustatic sea level based on geologic data span a broad range; variation that we now recognize is due in part to geographically varying post-depositional displacement caused by glacial isostatic adjustment and dynamic topography. In this study, we combine field observations and glacial isostatic adjustment modeling to estimate the dynamic topography signal in three areas that are important to paleo-sea level studies of the Mid-Pliocene warm period (South Africa, West Australia and southeastern United States). We show that dynamic topography played a significant role in the post-depositional displacement of Pliocene, and even younger Pleistocene, shorelines. In this regard, we provide a robust paleo-sea level elevation data set, corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment, that can be used to evaluate predictions from mantle flow models of dynamic topography.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

	abstract = {[Temperature reconstructions indicate that the Pliocene was approximately 3$\,^{\circ}$C warmer globally than today, and several recent reconstructions of Pliocene atmospheric CO₂ indicate that it was above pre-industrial levels and similar to those likely to be seen this century. However, many of these reconstructions have been of relatively low temporal resolution, meaning that these records may have failed to capture variations associated with the 41 kyr glacialinterglacial cycles thought to have operated in the Pliocene. Here we present a new, high temporal resolution alkenone carbon isotope-based record of pCO₂ spanning 3.3-2.8 Ma from Ocean Drilling Program Site 999. Our record is of high enough resolution (approx. 19 kyr) to resolve glacialinterglacial changes beyond the intrinsic uncertainty of the proxy method. The record suggests that Pliocene CO₂ levels were relatively stable, exhibiting variation less than 55ppm. We perform sensitivity studies to investigate the possible effect of changing sea surface temperature (SST), which highlights the importance of accurate and precise SST reconstructions for alkenone palaeobarometry, but demonstrate that these uncertainties do not affect our conclusions of relatively stable pCO₂ levels during this interval.]},

	abstract = {The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transfers c. 15 Sv (1 Sv ¼ 106 m3s21) of relatively cool, fresh water from the tropical Pacific Ocean to the tropical Indian Ocean. Additionally, the ITF is a key interocean component of the global ocean warm water route, which returns water from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean to close the loop of the thermohaline overturning circulation associated with North Atlantic Deep Water. That flow consequently freshens the Indian Ocean and transports heat between basins. The ITF can also be described by the island rule, which relates the winds over the entire South Pacific Ocean to the magnitude of the ITF. El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominates the regional variability in the Pacific Ocean and exerts a strong control over the variability of ITF transport. The Indian Ocean responds to the ENSO signal as well, but is also influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole, a climate phenomenon that may act independently of ENSO to affect the ITF.},

	abstract = {Evidence from sediments in cores collected from within the present oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ; 600--1200 m) on the central and northern California margins record several episodes during the last interstadial (OIS-3, ca. 60-24 ka) of deposition of laminated sediments containing elevated concentrations of several trace elements indicative of anoxic conditions (e.g., Mo, Ni, Zn, and Cu). The presence of abundant well-preserved organic matter, as well as lack of bioturbation and the presence of elevated concentrations of Mo and other trace elements, all support the theory that the OMZ in the northeastern Pacific Ocean was more intense, possibly anoxic, at several times during the late Pleistocene. Sediments of all ages in cores from the southern California margin contain elevated concentrations of Mo, suggesting that this area has always had higher rates of sulfate reduction than either the central or northern California areas. Most of the Ba in sediments in all cores collected on the upper continental slope (200--2700 m) off California and southern Oregon is derived from detrital clastic material, and this source did not change much in time. However, the amount of biogenic Ba did vary with time, and these variations closely follow the temporal variations in organic C (Corg) mass accumulation rate. Using Ba and Corg mass accumulation rates as proxy variables for productivity, all cores show that organic productivity under the California Current upwelling system was highest during OIS-3 and the Holocene, and lowest during the last glacial interval (LGI, ca. 24-10 ka). All paleoproductivity proxy variables indicate that the southern California area has always experienced higher productivity than other areas under the California Current, at least over the last 50 ky.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
Contourites occur closely interbedded with the other deep-water facies. They range from very fine-grained to relatively coarse-grained deposits and include siliciclastic, bioclastic, volcaniclastic, and chemogenic compositional varieties. This chapter reviews the depositional mechanisms of contourites at the large, intermediate, and small scales. The information derived from drift construction, erosion, sea-floor -bed -form development, and the detail of sediment facies characteristics are considered. It also explores when and where deposition gives way to non-deposition and erosion by bottom currents, and how a long-term accumulation of contourites can result from the alternation of deposition and erosion in time and space. The features and facies of contourites are determined by sedimentary structures, texture, and fabric. The characteristics and principle features of the bottom-current process are schematically represented. Estimated sediment flux from different inputs into the deep -water boundary current that flows over and feeds sediment to the Erik Drift is diagrammatically presented. The average sedimentation rate of contourite deposits varies significantly depending on the location with respect to long-term nature and velocity of the bottom-current system, volume, and source of sediment supply.},

@article{naafsLatePlioceneChanges2010,
	abstract = {During the late Pliocene global climate changed drastically as the Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) intensified. It remains poorly understood how the North Atlantic Current (NAC) changed in strength and position during this time interval. Such changes may alter the amount of northward heat transport and therefore have a large impact on climate in the circum-North Atlantic region and the growth of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Using the alkenone biomarker we reconstructed orbitally resolved sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity records at Integrated Ocean Drilling Project (IODP) Expedition 306 Site U1313 during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, 3.68--2.45million years ago (Ma). Before 3.1Ma, SSTs in the mid-latitude North Atlantic were up to 6$\,^{\circ}$C higher than the present and surface water productivity was low, indicating that an intense NAC transported warm, nutrient-poor surface waters northwards. Starting at 3.1Ma, surface water characteristics changed drastically as the NHG intensified. During glacial periods at the end of the late Pliocene and beginning of the Pleistocene, SSTs decreased and surface water productivity in the mid-latitude North Atlantic increased, reflecting a weakened influence of the NAC at our site. At the same time the increase in surface productivity suggests that the Arctic Front (AF) reached down into the mid-latitudes. We propose that during the intensification of the NHG the NAC had an almost pure west to east flow direction in glacials and did not penetrate into the higher latitudes. The diminished northward heat transport would have led to a cooling of the higher latitudes, which may have encouraged the growth of large continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.},

@article{frenzCarbonatePreservationPatterns2006,
	abstract = {Enhanced Atlantic overturning during the Pliocene was first proposed almost 10 yrs ago. Evidence for this Pliocene super conveyor scenario has been collected using a number of proxies (e.g., benthic δ13C, Nd isotopic composition of manganese crusts). The present study contributes to the existing evidences by using carbonate dissolution and current vigour history of early Pliocene sediments from the Cear{\'a} Rise (ODP Sites 927 and 929). In order to reveal carbonate dissolution history, a number of commonly used and newly established proxies were applied, i.e., sand and carbonate contents, foraminifer fragmentation index, Bulloides Dissolution Index and carbonate silt grain-size distributions. Terrigenous silt grain-size distributions were used to unravel variations in relative current strength and sediment input to the two sites. Overall good carbonate preservation at the shallow Site 927 (3314 m water depth) shows that this level was bathed in North Atlantic Deep Water throughout the early Pliocene. The contrastingly poor carbonate preservation record of the deeper Site 929 (4358 m water depth, at present exposed to Antarctic Bottom Water) is frequently interrupted by phases of good carbonate preservation. These results indicate that the depth of the calcite lysocline was mainly tied to present level (∼4200 m water depth), and sometimes even dropped to water depths greater than 4360 m due to even more enhanced circulation. Surprisingly the expansion of NADW is not clearly reflected by an increase in current speed as shown by continuously fine terrigenous grain size.},

            Estimating minimum ice volume during the last interglacial based on local sea-level indicators requires that these indicators are corrected for processes that alter local sea level relative to the global average. Although glacial isostatic adjustment is generally accounted for, global scale dynamic changes in topography driven by convective mantle flow are generally not considered. We use numerical models of mantle flow to quantify vertical deflections caused by dynamic topography and compare predictions at passive margins to a globally distributed set of last interglacial sea-level markers. The deflections predicted as a result of dynamic topography are significantly correlated with marker elevations ({\textgreater}95\% probability) and are consistent with construction and preservation attributes across marker types. We conclude that a dynamic topography signal is present in the elevation of last interglacial sea-level records and that the signal must be accounted for in any effort to determine peak global mean sea level during the last interglacial to within an accuracy of several meters.},

@article{dyerSealevelTrendsBahamas2021,
	abstract = {Significance
            The seas are rising as the planet warms, and reconstructions of past sea level provide critical insight into the sensitivity of ice sheets to warmer temperatures. Past sea level is reconstructed from the geologic record by measuring the elevations of fossilized marine sediments and coral reefs. However, the elevations of these features also record local uplift or subsidence due to the growth and decay of ice sheets since the time of deposition. We compare observations of paleo sea level across the Bahamian archipelago with a range of Earth deformation models to revise estimates of the last interglacial global mean sea level. Our results suggest that polar ice sheets may be less sensitive to high-latitude warming than previously thought.
          , 
            During the last interglacial (LIG) period, global mean sea level (GMSL) was higher than at present, likely driven by greater high-latitude insolation. Past sea-level estimates require elevation measurements and age determination of marine sediments that formed at or near sea level, and those elevations must be corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). However, this GIA correction is subject to uncertainties in the GIA model inputs, namely, Earth's rheology and past ice history, which reduces precision and accuracy in estimates of past GMSL. To better constrain the GIA process, we compare our data and existing LIG sea-level data across the Bahamian archipelago with a suite of 576 GIA model predictions. We calculated weights for each GIA model based on how well the model fits spatial trends in the regional sea-level data and then used the weighted GIA corrections to revise estimates of GMSL during the LIG. During the LIG, we find a 95\% probability that global sea level peaked at least 1.2 m higher than today, and it is very unlikely (5\% probability) to have exceeded 5.3 m. Estimates increase by up to 30\% (decrease by up to 20\%) for portions of melt that originate from the Greenland ice sheet (West Antarctic ice sheet). Altogether, this work suggests that LIG GMSL may be lower than previously assumed.},

@article{haySealevelFingerprintsIcesheet2014,
	abstract = {Studies of sea level during previous interglacials provide insight into the stability of polar ice sheets in the face of global climate change. Commonly, these studies correct ancient sea-level highstands for the contaminating effect of isostatic adjustment associated with past ice age cycles, and interpret the residuals as being equivalent to the peak eustatic sea level associated with excess melting, relative to present day, of ancient polar ice sheets. However, the collapse of polar ice sheets produces a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change, which must be accounted for to accurately infer peak eustatic sea level from site-specific residual highstands. To explore this issue, we compute fingerprints associated with the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to isolate regions that would have been subject to greater-thaneustatic sea-level change for all three cases. These fingerprints are more robust than those associated with modern melting events, when applied to infer eustatic sea level, because: (1) a significant collapse of polar ice sheets reduces the sensitivity of the computed fingerprints to uncertainties in the geometry of the melt regions; and (2) the sea-level signal associated with the collapse will dominate the signal from steric effects. We evaluate these fingerprints at a suite of sites where sea-level records from interglacial marine isotopes stages (MIS) 5e and 11 have been obtained. Using these results, we demonstrate that previously discrepant estimates of peak eustatic sea level during MIS5e based on sealevel markers in Australia and the Seychelles are brought into closer accord.},

One is a high-resolution benthonic record that contains superb detail but proves to record temperature change as well as ice volume; the other is a planktonic record from the west equatorial Pacific where the temperature effect may be minimal but where high resolution is not available. A combined record is generated which may be a better approximation to ice volume than was previously available. This approach cannot yet be applied to the whole Pleistocene. However, comparison of glacial extremes suggests that glacial extremes of stages 12 and 16 significantly exceeded the last glacial maximum as regards ice volume and hence as regards sea level lowering. Interglacial stages 7, 13, 15, 17 and 19 did not attain Holocene oxygen isotope values; possibly the sea did not reach its present level. It is unlikely that sea level was glacio-eustatically higher than present by more than a few metres during any interglacial of the past 2.5 million years.},

	abstract = {δ18O in foraminifera (δ18Oc) is a useful proxy for density, and the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can be reconstructed by the zonal density contrast in the Atlantic. However, whether the deglacial zonal δ18Oc contrast can represent the AMOC change is still unclear. δ18Oc contrast across the Florida Straits has been hypothesized as a proxy for the AMOC evolution during the last deglaciation, but the strength of Florida Current could also be influenced by wind forcing. Here we examine the ability of the zonal δ18Oc contrast to reconstruct AMOC in a deglacial model simulation. The model simulation suggests that the deglacial variation of the Florida Current strength is dominated by AMOC, with the wind effect on the variation of the Florida Current being negligible. Furthermore, the δ18Oc contrast across the western boundary along the entire Atlantic and the basin-wide δ18Oc contrast in the North Atlantic in the upper ocean can also be used to reconstruct AMOC. However, using basin-wide δ18Oc contrast to reconstruct AMOC in the South Atlantic is not possible at all water depths. In the subtropical South Atlantic, the basin-wide δ18Oc contrast is decoupled from the density contrast between 400 to 600 m through the deglaciation because of the deglacial change of the Antarctic Intermediate Water. Therefore, δ18Oc is a useful proxy to reconstruct past density and in turn past AMOC, but caution has to be used when using the basin-wide δ18Oc contrast to reconstruct the basin-wide density contrast in the South Atlantic.},

	abstract = {The vertical profile of meridional transport in the South Atlantic is examined by combining paleoceanographic observations with a geostrophic circulation model using an inverse method. δ18Ocalcite observations along the margins of the South Atlantic show that upper-ocean cross-basin differences were weaker during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than the Holocene. The δ18Ocalcite observations can be explained by a shift of water-mass properties without any change in the overturning circulation. Alternatively, they may indicate a reduced LGM cross-basin density difference and, via the thermal wind relation, a reduced vertical shear. Model inversions of δ18Ocalcite are found to require meridional transports different from the modern only after three assumptions are made: temperature and salinity distributions are spatially smooth, the relationship between salinity and δ18Owater is linear and spatially invariant, and LGM temperatures are known to within 1$\,^{\circ}$C along the margins. The last assumption is necessary because an independent constraint on temperature or salinity is required to determine density from δ18Ocalcite observations. δ18Ocalcite observations are clearly useful, but before any firm constraints can be placed on LGM meridional transport, it appears necessary to better determine the relationship between δ18Ocalcite and density.},

	abstract = {The geostrophic shear associated with the meridional overturning circulation is reflected in the difference in density between the eastern and western margins of the ocean basin. Here we examine how the density difference across 30$\,^{\circ}$S in the upper 2 km of the Atlantic Ocean (and thus the magnitude of the shear associated with the overturning circulation) has changed between the last glacial maximum and the present. We use oxygen isotope measurements on benthic foraminifera to reconstruct density. Today, the density in upper and intermediate waters along the eastern margin in the South Atlantic is greater than along the western margin, reflecting the vertical shear associated with the northward flow of surface and intermediate waters and the southward flowing North Atlantic Deep Waters below. The greater density along the eastern margin is reflected in the higher δ18O values for surface sediment benthic foraminifera than those found on the western margin for the upper 2 km. For the last glacial maximum the available data indicate that the eastern margin foraminifera had similar δ18O to those on the western margin between 1 and 2 km and that the gradient was reversed relative to today with the higher δ18O values in the western margin benthic foraminifera above 1 km. If this reversal in benthic foraminifera δ18O gradient reflects a reversal in seawater density gradient, these data are not consistent with a vigorous but shallower overturning cell in which surface waters entering the Atlantic basin are balanced by the southward export of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water.},

@article{hayTectonicsClimate1996,
	abstract = {Tectonics and climate are both directly and indirectly related. The direct connection is between uplift, atmospheric circulation, and the hydrologic cycle. The indirect links are via subduction, volcanism, the introduction of gasses into the atmosphere, and through erosion and consumption of atmospheric gases by chemical weathering. Rifting of continental blocks involves broad upwarping followed by subsidence of a central valley and uplift of marginal shoulders. The result is an evolving regional climate which has been repeated many times in the Phanerozoic: first a vapor-trapping arch, followed by a rift valley with fresh-water lakes, culminating in an arid rift bordered by mountains intercepting incoming precipitation. Convergence tectonics affects climate on a larger scale. A mountain range is a barrier to atmospheric circulation, especially if perpendicular to the circulation. It also traps water vapor converting latent to sensible heat. Broad uplift results in a shorter path for both incoming and outgoing radiation resulting in seasonal climate extremes with reversals of atmospheric pressure and enhanced monsoonal circulation. Volcanism affects climate by introducing ash and aerosols into the atmosphere, but unless these are injected into the stratosphere, they have little effect. Stratospheric injection is most likely to occur at high latitudes, where the thickness of the troposphere is minimal. Volcanoes introduce CO2, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Geochemical effects of tectonic uplift and unroofing relate to the weathering of silicate rocks, the means by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere-ocean system on long-term time scales.},

They are also transported over short and long distances with consequences for continental-scale nutrient availability. Processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere are difficult to evaluate with observations in isolation from aerosol sources. As a result, a quantitative assessment of uncertainties in our understanding of aerosols is limited and narrowing of those uncertainties is difficult to demonstrate. In this study, we use satellite observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and aerosols downwind of the K{\=\i}lauea volcano during May--September 2008. We derive the SO2 emission rate, the loss rate of SO2 that is indicative of the production rate of sulfate aerosols, and the subsequent removal rate of the formed sulfate. The result is the first determination of volcanic sulfate aerosol lifetime, 40--64 h, directly from satellite observations. The derived sulfate lifetime is significantly lower than the global average (3--5.5 days) and reflects the rapid wet scavenging of this plume.},

@article{zhuPersistingVolcanicAsh2020,
	abstract = {Volcanic ash is often neglected in climate simulations because ash particles are assumed to have a short atmospheric lifetime, and to not participate in sulfur chemistry. After the Mt. Kelut eruption in 2014, stratospheric ash-rich aerosols were observed for months. Here we show that the persistence of super-micron ash is consistent with a density near 0.5 g cm−3, close to pumice. Ash-rich particles dominate the volcanic cloud optical properties for the first 60 days. We also find that the initial SO2 lifetime is determined by SO2 uptake on ash, rather than by reaction with OH as commonly assumed. About 43\% more volcanic sulfur is removed from the stratosphere in 2 months with the SO2 heterogeneous chemistry on ash particles than without. This research suggests the need for re-evaluation of factors controlling SO2 lifetime in climate model simulations, and of the impact of volcanic ash on stratospheric chemistry and radiation.},

Accelerating research on this topic is critical in view of rapid climate change driven by anthropogenic activities. Over the last two decades, we have improved our understanding of how mass distribution on the Earth's surface, in particular changes in ice and water distribution linked to glacial cycles, affects mantle melting, crustal magmatic processing and eruption rates. New hypotheses on the impacts of climate change on eruption processes have also emerged, including how eruption style and volcanic plume rise are affected by changing surface and atmospheric conditions, and how volcanic sulfate aerosol lifecycle, radiative forcing and climate impacts are modulated by background climate conditions. Future improvements in past climate reconstructions and current climate observations, volcanic eruption records and volcano monitoring, and numerical models all have a role in advancing our understanding of climate-volcano impacts. Important mechanisms remain to be explored, such as how changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation will affect the volcanic ash life cycle. Fostering a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to climate-volcano impacts is critical to gain a full picture of how ongoing climate changes may affect the environmental and societal impacts of volcanic activity.},

@article{wattVolcanicResponseDeglaciation2013,
	abstract = {Several lines of evidence have previously been used to suggest that ice retreat after the last glacial maximum (LGM) resulted in regionally-increased levels of volcanic activity. It has been proposed that this increase in volcanism was globally significant, forming a substantial component of the post-glacial rise in atmospheric CO2, and thereby contributing to climatic warming. However, as yet there has been no detailed investigation of activity in glaciated volcanic arcs following the LGM. Arc volcanism accounts for 90\% of present-day subaerial volcanic eruptions. It is therefore important to constrain the impact of deglaciation on arc volcanoes, to understand fully the nature and magnitude of global-scale relationships between volcanism and glaciation. The first part of this paper examines the post-glacial explosive eruption history of the Andean southern volcanic zone (SVZ), a typical arc system, with additional data from the Kamchatka and Cascade arcs. In all cases, eruption rates in the early post-glacial period do not exceed those at later times at a statistically significant level. In part, the recognition and quantification of what may be small (i.e. less than a factor of two) increases in eruption rate is hindered by the size of our datasets. These datasets are limited to eruptions larger than 0.1km3, because deviations from power-law magnitude--frequency relationships indicate strong relative under-sampling at smaller eruption volumes. In the southern SVZ, where ice unloading was greatest, eruption frequency in the early post-glacial period is approximately twice that of the mid post-glacial period (although frequency increases again in the late post-glacial). A comparable pattern occurs in Kamchatka, but is not observed in the Cascade arc. The early post-glacial period also coincides with a small number of very large explosive eruptions from the most active volcanoes in the southern and central SVZ, consistent with enhanced ponding of magma during glaciation and release upon deglaciation. In comparison to non-arc settings, evidence of post-glacial increases in rates of arc volcanism is weak, and there is no need to invoke significantly increased melt production upon ice unloading, as occurred in areas such as Iceland. Non-arc volcanoes may therefore account for a relatively higher proportion of global volcanic emissions in the early post-glacial period than is suggested by the relative contributions of arc and non-arc settings at the present day. The second part of this paper critically examines global eruption records, in an effort to constrain global-scale changes in volcanic output since the LGM. Accurate interpretation of these records relies on correcting both temporal and spatial variability in eruption recording. In particular, very low recording rates, which also vary spatially by over two orders of magnitude, prevent precise, and possibly even accurate, quantitative analysis. For example, if we assume record completeness for the past century, the number of known eruptions (volcanic explosivity index≥2) from some low-latitude regions, such as Indonesia, is approximately 1 in 20,000 (0.005\%) for the period 5--20ka. There is a need for more regional-scale studies of past volcanism in such regions, where current data are extremely sparse. We attempt to correct for recording biases, and suggest a maximum two-fold (but potentially much less) increase in global eruption rates, relative to the present day, between 13 and 7ka. Although volcanism may have been an important source of CO2 in the early Holocene, it is unlikely to have been a dominant control on changes in atmospheric CO2 after the LGM.},

@article{boulahanisSeaLevelVariations2020,
	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that eustatic sea level fluctuations induced by glacial cycles in the Pleistocene influence mantle-melting and volcanic eruptions at mid-ocean ridges, with models predicting variations in oceanic crustal thickness and seafloor bathymetry linked to sea level change. Analyses of seafloor bathymetry have found evidence of significant spectral energy at frequencies consistent with Milankovi{\'c} cycles of 1/23, 1/41, and 1/80-1/120 ka−1. However, other studies emphasize the need for crustal thickness observations to test the ``sea level hypothesis''. Here we investigate the hypothesis of climate driven periodicity in mid-ocean ridge magmatism through analysis of a unique bathymetry and crustal thickness dataset derived from a 3D multi-channel seismic investigation of the East Pacific Rise from 9$\,^{\circ}$42' to 57′N. Crustal thickness data spans the last ∼235 ka in age and reveals three axis-parallel zones of 200-800 m thicker crust. The amplitude and spacing of these thick crust ridges, which are most prominent on the east flank of the ridge, are consistent with predictions of sea level modulated mantle melting. Similarly spaced ridges are apparent in the longer duration (470 ka) seafloor bathymetry data. Spectral analysis of these datasets shows peaks centered near 1/80 ka−1 and locally near 1/41 ka−1 on the east flank in both bathymetry and crustal thickness. West flank spectral results show intermittent peaks near 1/100 ka−1 and 1/41 ka−1 in crustal thickness and no coherent peak frequencies in bathymetry data. We attribute differences between the east and west flank to the impacts of spatially variable asymmetric spreading and small changes in the locus of accretion. Observed half spreading rates are dominantly faster to the east with small ridge jumps transferring crust from the west flank. Lagged cross-correlations between sea level and crustal thickness indicate a maximum when the latter is lagged by ∼45 ka, which align thick crust zones with the ∼100 ka periods of lower sea level. Crustal thickness is also directly compared with seafloor bathymetry, indicating a component of compensated topography with RMS relief at the seafloor of 10 to 29\% of crustal thickness variations. However, complexity inherited from variable asymmetric spreading and seafloor faulting is also apparent, and results provide new insights into how the crustal accretion filter modulates the recording of magma supply variations in the crust and in seafloor relief. While the significance of the statistical analysis of these ridge records is limited by the short duration of the available crustal thickness dataset and effects of asymmetric spreading, the novel observations of crustal thickness varying at timescales of ∼80-100 ka require a mechanism, and the sea level hypothesis provides a plausible explanation.},

@article{kutterolfMilankovitchFrequenciesTephra2019,
	abstract = {The increase in volcanic activity after the last glacial maximum observed on Iceland has led to one of the most fascinating hypothesis in science in the last decades: that deglaciation may force volcanism. Consequently, tephrostratigraphic records of sufficient length that cover multiple glacial cycles have been used to test whether such relationships hold systematically through the Quaternary. Here we review such tephra records that have been linked with climate proxy records such as δ18O in marine sediments, which is a measure of sea-level change and which is thought to be orbitally forced, as it exhibits the characteristic Milankovitch periodicities of precession (∼23 kyr), obliquity (∼41 kyr) and eccentricity (∼100 kyr). Statistical analyses have identified these periodicities also in long tephra records from different latitudes and geotectonic settings, as well as in compiled semi-global records. These studies detect Milankovitch periods in their tephra record, and also a phase shift relative to the δ18O record in such that periods of increased eruption frequencies coincide with the deglaciation period at the glacial/interglacial transition when ice and water loads on the lithosphere change most rapidly. However, there are also disparities in results and interpretations, which may be attributable to the different methods of analysis applied by the studies. We have therefore re-analyzed the four best-characterized tephra records by the same methods. We distinguish between analysis in the frequency domain, a novel approach, and analysis in the time domain, which has been used in previous studies. Analysis in the frequency domain identifies harmonic frequencies that arise from the binary nature of the tephra records and complicate the identification of primary frequencies. However, we show that all four records show spectral density peaks near the main Milankovitch periodicities of 41 and 100 kyr, and that they produce meaningful and significant statistical correlations with each other and the global δ18O record but not with random time series. Although the time-domain correlations with δ18O roughly confirm phase shifts implying peak volcanism during deglaciation, correlation coefficients arising from very noisy records are generally too low for precise constraints on the relative timing. These deficiencies presently hamper the recognition of the physical mechanisms through which global climate changes affect volcanism at both, high-latitude glaciated regions and low-latitude non-glaciated regions.},

@article{steinkeMgCaRatios2005,
	abstract = {Tests of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white; d'Orbigny) have become a standard tool for reconstructing past oceanic environments. Paleoceanographers often utilize the Mg/Ca ratios of the foraminiferal tests for reconstructing low-latitude ocean glacial-interglacial changes in sea surface temperatures (SST). We report herein a comparison of Mg/Ca measurements on sample pairs (n = 20) of two G. ruber (white) morphotypes (G. ruber sensu stricto (s.s.) and G. ruber sensu lato (s.l.)) from surface and downcore samples of the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. G. ruber s.s. refers to specimens with spherical chambers sitting symmetrically over previous sutures with a wide, high arched aperture, whereas G. ruber s.l. refers to a more compact test with a diminutive final chamber and small aperture. The G. ruber s.s. specimens generally show significantly higher Mg/Ca ratios compared to G. ruber s.l. Our results from the Mg/Ca ratio analysis suggest that G. ruber s.l. specimens precipitated their shells in slightly colder surface waters than G. ruber s.s. specimens. This conclusion is supported by the differences in δ18O and δ13C values between the two morphotypes. Although it is still unclear if these two morphotypes represent phenotypic variants or sibling species, our findings seem to support the hypothesis of depth and/or seasonal allopatry within a single morphospecies.},

@article{schmittSingleForaminiferaMg2019,
	abstract = {The ratio of magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) in foraminiferal shells is commonly used as a proxy for past ocean temperature. Recent advances in elemental analyses now enable single-specimen measurements of planktic foraminifera and thus, can provide information on past seasonal and interannual variability, owing to the near-monthly lifespan of foraminifera. In this study, we explore the temperature variance recorded by Mg/Ca in tests of foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber, a planktic species that occurs throughout the year in tropical waters. Using LA-ICP-MS, we characterize Mg/Ca variability in single specimens of two morphotypes of G. ruber picked from a sediment core retrieved offshore New Caledonia. We provide an estimate of the range of calcification temperatures for these morphotypes during five interglacial-glacial cycles over the last 1.55 Ma. First, we find significant and systematic differences between the morphotypes and second, the temperature difference between morphotypes does not remain constant through time. Our results highlight a progressive increase in surface-water temperatures during interglacials and a progressive decrease in glacial subsurface water temperatures. These changes in surface and subsurface temperatures potentially highlight a change in the stratification of the water column over the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. We conclude that single-specimen Mg/Ca on foraminiferal morphotypes can offer unique perspectives on paleoenvironmental reconstructions.},

@article{weldeabComparisonForaminiferalCleaning2006,
	abstract = {A down-core comparison of two commonly applied foraminiferal cleaning procedures for Mg/Ca paleothermometry has been conducted using well-preserved Globigerinoides ruber white (250--300 μm) from core material deposited under varying terrigenous-input and bottom water conditions. This study demonstrates that in the majority of investigated core materials, both cleaning methods yield fairly comparable results of Mg/Ca ratios. However, Fe and Mn phases are effectively removed by the cleaning procedure containing a reductive step. In a core interval indicating gradual transition of terrigenous deposition and pore water conditions, the cleaning procedure without a reductive step results in anomalously higher Mg/Ca ratios accompanied by high Fe/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios, indicating the presence of high-Mg contaminants. Considering that the Mg/Ca deviation of the comparison study is the cumulative sum of (1) the difference in cleaning efficiency of the applied methods, (2) the cleaning-method-dependent partial dissolution of Mg, and (3) the heterogeneity of subsamples, we suggest that selective Mg loss from well-preserved Globigerinoides ruber shells caused by the reductive sample treatment is not substantial enough to significantly bias paleotemperature estimation. Thus, for core material deposited under varying sources and amounts of terrigenous material and bottom water conditions favorable for formation of authigenic mineral phases, the use of cleaning methods that do include a reductive step yields more effective cleaning results by successful removal of mineral phases that may contain high Mg.},

@article{daviesWidespreadDispersalIcelandic2010,
	abstract = {The Eyjafj{\"o}ll AD 2010 eruption is an extraordinary event in that it led to widespread and unprecedented disruption to air travel over Europe -- a region generally considered to be free from the hazards associated with volcanic eruptions. Following the onset of the eruption, satellite imagery demonstrated the rapid transportation of ash by westerly winds over mainland Europe, eventually expanding to large swathes of the North Atlantic Ocean and the eastern seaboard of Canada. This small-to-intermediate size eruption and the dispersal pattern observed are not particularly unusual for Icelandic eruptions within a longer-term perspective. Indeed, the Eyjafj{\"o}ll eruption is a relatively modest eruption in comparison to some of the 20 most voluminous eruptions that have deposited cryptotephra in sedimentary archives in mainland Europe, such as the mid Younger Dryas Vedde Ash and the mid Holocene Hekla 4 tephra. The 2010 eruption, however, highlights the critical role that weather patterns play in the distribution of a relatively small amount of ash and also highlights the spatially complex dispersal trajectories of tephra in the atmosphere. Whether or not the preservation of the Eyjafj{\"o}ll 2010 tephra in European proxy archives will correspond to the extensive distributions mapped in the atmosphere remains to be seen. The Eyjafj{\"o}ll 2010 event highlights our increased vulnerability to natural hazards rather than the unparalleled explosivity of the event. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{garcinHydroclimaticVulnerabilityPeat2022,
	abstract = {The forested swamps of the central Congo Basin store approximately 30 billion metric tonnes of carbon in peat1,2. Little is known about the vulnerability of these carbon stocks. Here we investigate this vulnerability using peat cores from a large interfluvial basin in the Republic of the Congo and palaeoenvironmental methods. We find that peat accumulation began at least at 17,500 calibrated years before present (cal. yr bp; taken as ad 1950). Our data show that the peat that accumulated between around 7,500 to around 2,000 cal. yr bp is much more decomposed compared with older and younger peat. Hydrogen isotopes of plant waxes indicate a drying trend, starting at approximately 5,000 cal. yr bp and culminating at approximately 2,000 cal. yr bp, coeval with a decline in dominant swamp forest taxa. The data imply that the drying climate probably resulted in a regional drop in the water table, which triggered peat decomposition, including the loss of peat carbon accumulated prior to the onset of the drier conditions. After approximately 2,000 cal. yr bp, our data show that the drying trend ceased, hydrologic conditions stabilized and peat accumulation resumed. This reversible accumulation--loss--accumulation pattern is consistent with other peat cores across the region, indicating that the carbon stocks of the central Congo peatlands may lie close to a climatically driven drought threshold. Further research should quantify the combination of peatland threshold behaviour and droughts driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions that may trigger this positive carbon cycle feedback in the Earth system.},

@article{fontelaNorthAtlanticWestern2020,
	abstract = {In the North Atlantic, there are two main western boundary currents related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC): the Gulf Stream flowing northward and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) flowing southward. Here we analyze data from the OVIDE section (GO-SHIP A25 Portugal-Greenland 40--60$\,^{\circ}$N) that crosses the DWBC and the northward extension of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Current. We show that North Atlantic western boundary currents play a key role in the transport of dissolved organic matter, specifically dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Revisited transports and budgets of DOC with new available data identify the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic (eSPNA) as an important source of locally produced organic matter for the North Atlantic and a key region in the supply of bioavailable DOC to the deep ocean. The East Greenland Current, and its upstream source the East Reykjanes Ridge Current on the eastern flank of the mid-Atlantic ridge, are export pathways of bioavailable DOC toward subtropical latitudes. The fast overturning and subsequent remineralization of DOC produced in the autotrophic eSPNA explains up to 38\% of the total oxygen consumption in the deep North Atlantic between the OVIDE section and 24$\,^{\circ}$N. Carbon budgets that do not take into account this organic remineralization process overestimates the natural uptake of carbon dioxide (CO
              2
              ) from the atmosphere by one third. The inclusion of DOC transports in regional carbon budgets reconciles the estimates of CO

              uptake in the North Atlantic between model and observations.},

@article{jonkersDeepCirculationChanges2015,
	abstract = {Previous work showed that South Atlantic sediments have lower glacial than Holocene 231Pa/230Th, which was attributed to a switch in the flow direction of Atlantic deep-water. Debate exists, however as to the degree to which two processes -- circulation and scavenging -- determine sedimentary 231Pa/230Th, making this interpretation contentious. Here we address this issue using 145-kyr records of paleocirculation proxies. Benthic foraminiferal δC13, neodymium isotopes (εNd) and sedimentary 231Pa/230Th were all measured in a single sediment core from the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. This site largely excludes the influence of local productivity changes on 231Pa/230Th records. Measured 231Pa/230Th ranges between ∼0.041 during glacials and ∼0.055 during interglacial periods and is consistently lower than the production ratio, indicating export of 231Pa from the central South Atlantic for the entire duration of the record. The lower glacial 231Pa/230Th is regionally consistent, suggesting that basin-scale oceanographic processes cause the decrease. In turn, less radiogenic εNd and lower benthic δC13 confirm the classical picture of an increase in Southern Component Water (SCW) influence in the Atlantic during glacial periods and point to a circulation control on the observed 231Pa/230Th decrease rather than a local productivity change. We suggest that associated with this change in water mass distribution the dominant sink for 231Pa shifted from the margins of the South Atlantic and/or the Southern Ocean during interglacials, to the North Atlantic during glacial periods. Indeed, elevated 231Pa/230Th in the deep North Atlantic during glacials supports this mechanism of northward transport of 231Pa by SCW.},

Closing the Panamanian Isthmus increased thermohaline circulation and enhanced moisture supply to high latitudes, but the accompanying heat would have inhibited ice growth. One possible solution is that enhanced moisture transported to Eurasia also enhanced freshwater delivery to the Arctic via Siberian rivers. Freshwater input to the Arctic would facilitate sea ice formation, increase the albedo, and isolate the high heat capacity of the ocean from the atmosphere. It would also act as a negative feedback on the efficiency of the ``conveyor belt'' heat pump.},

@techreport{jiangNoChangesOverall2022,
	abstract = {Abstract. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key mechanism of poleward heat transport and an important part of the global climate system. How it responded to past changes in forcing, such as experienced during Quaternary interglacials, is an intriguing and open question. Previous modelling studies suggest an enhanced AMOC in the mid-Holocene compared to the pre-industrial period. In earlier simulations from the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), this arose from feedbacks between sea ice and AMOC changes, which were dependent on resolution. Here we present an initial analysis of the recently available PMIP4 simulations. The ensemble mean of the PMIP4 models shows the strength of the AMOC does not markedly change between the midHolocene and piControl experiments or between the lig127k and piControl experiments. Therefore, it appears orbital forcing itself does not alter the overall AMOC. We further investigate the coherency of the forced response in AMOC across the two interglacials, along with the strength of the signal, using eight PMIP4 models which performed both interglacial experiments. Only 2 models show a stronger change with the stronger forcing, but those models disagree on the direction of the change. We propose that the strong signals in these 2 models are caused by a combination of forcing and the internal variability. After investigating the AMOC changes in the interglacials, we further explored the impact of AMOC on the climate system, especially on the changes in the simulated surface temperature and precipitation. After identifying the AMOC's fingerprint on the surface temperature and rainfall, we demonstrate that only a small percentage of the simulated surface climate changes can be attributed to the AMOC. Proxy records during the two interglacial periods paint a similar picture of minimal changes, which fits nicely with the simulated results. Although the overall AMOC strength shows minimal changes, future work is required to explore whether this occurs through compensating variations in the different components of AMOC (such as Iceland-Scotland overflow water). This lines of evidence caution against interpreting reconstructions of past interglacial climate as being driven by AMOC, outside of abrupt events.},

@article{guihouEnhancedAtlanticMeridional2011,
	abstract = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key feature of the climate system. However, its role during climate change is still poorly constrained particularly during an Interglacial to Glacial climate transition and the associated global cooling. We present here the first reconstruction of the evolution of the vertical structure of the rate of the AMOC from the Last Interglaciation to the subsequent glaciation (128,000--60,000 years ago) based on sedimentary (231Pa/230Th) records. We show a deep AMOC during the interglacial warmth Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5.5 and a shallower glacial one during glacial MIS 4. The change between these two patterns occurred mostly during the glacial inception, i.e. the transition from MIS 5.5 to MIS 5.4. Our data show that AMOC was enhanced during this latter transition as a consequence of a large increase of the overturning rate of the Intermediate Waters, above 2500 m. We suggest that this AMOC pattern required a reinforced Gulf Stream-North Atlantic Current system that ultimately supported ice-sheet growth by providing heat and moisture to the Northern high latitudes. From MIS 5.4 to MIS 5.1, the AMOC was broadly continuous below 2000m and supported periods of ice-sheet growth. As a result, a glacial AMOC is triggered at the beginning of MIS 4 due to the extension of ice-sheet and the subsequent reorganization of deep-water formation. This study highlights the role of intermediate waters as a major player during climate change.},
